INTRODUCTION

Thyroid cancer incidence in the United States (U.S.) has tripled over the past three decades, rising from
5.5 per 100,000 people in 1990 to 13.4 per 100,000 in 2022.! It is now among the most common cancer in
American adults aged 16-33, and the fifth most frequent cancer in women.’ In 2025, an estimated 44,020
new cases are expected, largely driven by small papillary thyroid cancers (<1.5 cm).'? Despite the rise in
incidence, mortality has remained low, leading to concerns about overdiagnosis due to detection of
subclinical cancers unlikely to cause harm, which often result in unnecessary imaging, treatments, related
adverse events, and significant financial burdens.**

A primary driver of this overdiagnosis is the escalating use of advanced medical imaging for indications
unrelated to the thyroid. The number of CT scans performed annually in the U.S. has surged from 72
million in 2007 to nearly 93 million today, leading to a parallel increase in incidental thyroid findings
(ITFs).©’ A recent meta-analysis confirms the scale of this issue, estimating the prevalence of ITF on CT
scans to be 8.3%.* Each of these findings represents the potential start of a diagnostic cascade of further
imaging, biopsies, and surgeries that may not offer clinical benefit.

Yet, despite their frequency and potential impact, incidental thyroid findings (ITFs) remain poorly
characterized. Critical gaps persist in understanding their epidemiology, diagnostic evaluation,
sonographic and radiographic features, and clinical outcomes. These uncertainties have contributed to
inconsistent guidance: among the four major U.S. societies addressing thyroid nodules, two recommend
ultrasound evaluation for all ITFs when a nodule is present, whereas others advocate selective evaluation
based on nodule size, age, or comorbidities.*'” Progress has been limited because essential data is
embedded within the unstructured narrative text of imaging reports within the electronic health record
(EHR). Manual abstraction is neither feasible nor scalable, constraining prior research to small cohorts
and limiting its generalizability.

Artificial intelligence (AI), especially natural language processing (NLP) techniques, offers a
transformative solution to this long-standing data challenge.'* By automating the analysis of unstructured
text, NLP can unlock the rich clinical details embedded in radiology reports at an unprecedented scale.'*
However, a systematic review of prior work reveals that existing NLP algorithms for thyroid conditions
have primarily focused on thyroid nodules using radiology reports. These algorithms have largely
explored automation and classifications tasks (categorizing as benign vs malignant) rather than
performing granular characterization of the nodular features or extracting radiology recommendations,
both necessary to understand the drivers of the diagnostic cascade. '°

Therefore, this study was designed to address these critical gaps. We developed and validated a novel,
high-performance NLP pipeline to automate the identification of ITFs and, specifically, the detailed
characterization of incidental thyroid nodules (ITNs). This characterization included extracting their
radiologic features and management recommendations from a wide array of imaging modalities.
Subsequently, we deployed this system across a large, multi-site healthcare network to quantify the
association between these incidentally detected findings and the subsequent cascade of diagnostic
interventions and thyroid cancer diagnoses.

METHODS
Data source and study population

We conducted a retrospective study of adult patients who received care at Mayo Clinic sites in Rochester,
Minnesota; Jacksonville, Florida; Scottsdale, Arizona, or the Mayo Clinic Health System (MCHS) in
Minnesota and Wisconsin between July 1, 2017, and September 30, 2023. We used Current Procedural
Terminology (CPT) and International Classification of Diseases (ICD) codes (Supplemental Table 1), to
identify adult patients (=18 years) who underwent imaging studies likely to incidentally capture the
thyroid, including computed tomography (CT); magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the neck or chest;
positron emission tomography combined with CT (PET/CT); carotid ultrasonography; parathyroid
scintigraphy; octreotide scintigraphy; nuclear cardiac stress testing; and head or neck ultrasonography
performed for non-thyroid indications. The study was approved by Mayo Clinic Institutional Review
Board (23-003644).

To identify a cohort of newly detected ITFs, we applied strict exclusion criteria. We excluded patients
with any prior diagnosis of thyroid nodule, thyroid cancer, hyperthyroidism, or a history of thyroidectomy
or thyroid biopsy, using a comprehensive list of diagnostic and procedural codes (Supplemental Table 1).
To ensure the absence of pre-existing thyroid disease, we required at least 12 months of continuous EHR
data before the index imaging study. If patients had multiple qualifying imaging studies on the same day,
we randomly selected one for inclusion to avoid duplication.

Development of the NLP system

To automate the identification and characterization of ITFs from unstructured imaging reports, we
developed a two-stage, transformer-based NLP pipeline. We began with a convenience sample of 2,000
reports, manually reviewed to ensure representation across three categories: (1) no thyroid findings, (2)
incidental non-nodular thyroid abnormalities (e.g., diffuse parenchymal changes), and (3) ITN. From this
sample, we selected 300 reports for model development, maintaining the approximate distribution across
categories (~50% no finding, ~45% ITN, ~5% non-nodular).

Each report was independently annotated by at least two clinically trained reviewers using MedTator, an
annotation tool that supports data labeling for NLP use, to capture the presence and type of ITF (ITN vs
non-nodular).'° When applicable, reviewers also recorded nodule size and radiologic features consistent
with those reported in routine imaging practice, including location (right, left, bilateral, isthmus), density,
enhancement, calcifications, attenuation, and metabolic activity, as well as whether the radiologist
recommended follow-up (e.g., ultrasound, additional imaging, or other testing). Annotation guidelines
(Supplemental Table 2 & Supplemental Figure 1) were refined through iterative pilot testing until the
inter-annotator agreement was high (« > 0.8). To address false-positive classifications identified during
preliminary model testing, an additional 60 reports were annotated and incorporated into the training set,
improving model precision.

The NLP pipeline consisted of two sequential components. First, a classification module determined
whether a report contained any ITF (Supplemental Figure 2). We fine-tuned multiple transformer models,
including BioBERT, BioClinicalBERT, and GatorTron. Reports classified as positive were further


===== PAGE BREAK =====

categorized into ITNs or non-nodular findings using rule-based logic. Second, for reports containing
ITNs, a named entity recognition (NER) module was developed to extract structured nodule attributes
(Supplemental Figure 3). Three models, BERT-base, RoBERTa, and a domain-specific Medical-
NER,were trained to identify ITN location, size, radiologic features, and follow-up recommendations
(Supplemental Table 3). For the classification task (determining whether a report contained an ITF),
BioClinicalBERT achieved the best performance (Testing F1-score 0.97). For the entity recognition task
(extracting ITN attributes), Medical-NER performed best (Testing F1-score 0.81) (Supplemental Tables 4
and 5).

Baseline variables and study outcomes

For the overall cohort, we extracted baseline variables from the 12 months preceding the index imaging
study. Demographic characteristics included age, sex, race, ethnicity, educational attainment, marital
status, primary language, and insurance status. Employment and financial strain (as recorded within the
social determinants of health) were also captured. Clinical variables included Body Mass Index (BMI)
and comorbidity burden, measured using the Charlson Comorbidity Index.'’ Imaging-related variables
included modality and body region examined. For patients with ITNs, additional radiologic features were
extracted using the NLP pipeline in accordance with predefined categories: location (right, left, bilateral,
isthmus), size, density, enhancement, calcifications, attenuation, metabolic activity, and metabolic
distribution. We also captured whether the interpreting radiologist included a recommendation for further
evaluation (e.g., ultrasound, additional imaging, or other testing).

The primary outcomes were the prevalence of ITFs and the proportion of patients with ITNs identified.
Secondary outcomes included subsequent thyroid-directed evaluations and diagnoses following the index
imaging study. Specifically, outcomes of interest were thyroid ultrasound, thyroid biopsy, thyroidectomy
(partial or total), and new diagnoses of thyroid nodules or thyroid cancer. Thyroid ultrasound was
considered a downstream outcome if performed within 180 days of the index imaging. Biopsy,
thyroidectomy (partial or total), and new diagnoses of thyroid nodules or thyroid cancer were included if
they occurred within 180 days after a thyroid ultrasound. Outcomes were ascertained using ICD and CPT
codes (Supplemental Table 1).

For thyroid cancer ascertainment, a single diagnostic code has been shown to be insufficient for
confirmation.'® To reduce false positives, we applied stricter criteria. If thyroid surgery was performed, a
single thyroid cancer diagnostic code after the surgery date was considered sufficient, given that surgery
typically implies pathological confirmation. If thyroid surgery was not performed, at least three instances
of a thyroid cancer diagnostic code were required to confirm the diagnosis. This approach increased
specificity, consistent with the principle that multiple code occurrences enhance diagnostic certainty when
relying on administrative data. Finally, a manual EHR review of confirmed cases was performed to
extract tumor histology and size.

Statistical analysis

Descriptive statistics were used to summarize the variables of interest. Means and standard deviations
(SD) were reported for continuous variables and counts and percentages were reported for categorical

variables. Univariate logistic regression models were conducted to assess the associations of clinical
characteristics and an incidental finding being present.

To identify factors associated with incidental findings, a multivariable logistic regression with Least
Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator (LASSO) selection was performed, with a selection criterion
of Schwarz Bayesian Criterion (SBC).'? Candidate covariates included patient factors (sex, age, BMI,
race, ethnicity, primary language, marital status, insurance, Charlson comorbidity index), clinician factors
(specialty, sex, credentials) and imaging factors (modality, body location). Factors of interest selected
were patient age, patient sex, BMI, modality description, body group and specialty. A significant
interaction term modality description and body group was found to be highly significant (p<0.0001)
assessed by the likelihood ratio chi-square test statistic, indicating that the effect of imaging modality on
incidental findings varies by body region. Odds ratios and 95% confidence intervals (95% CI) were
estimated for all predictors in the final model.

Model assumptions were verified. The Hosmer-Lemeshow goodness-of-fit test yielded a p-value of 0.15,
indicating no evidence of poor model fit. The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve
(AUC) was 0.74, suggesting good discrimination. Influential observations (Cook’s distance > 0.5) were
assessed and had minimal impact (< 10% coefficient change upon removal). Data management and
statistical analysis were performed using SAS version 9.4 (SAS Institute, Inc., Cary, NC). Complete case
analysis was used, as missing data for the variables of interest were minimal (< 7%).”°

RESULTS
Study Cohort Demographics

The final cohort comprised 115,683 patients and corresponding unique radiology reports (Figure 1). The
mean age was 56.8 years (SD 17.2), and the majority of patients were female (52.9%), White (91.0%),
and not Hispanic (94.5%). Most patients had private insurance (51.5%) or Medicare (36.5%). The most
common imaging modality was CT (62.5%), and the most frequent body location imaged was the chest
(44.9%). Complete demographic details are provided in Table 1. Charlton comorbidity index and ordering
clinician characteristics can be found in Supplemental Tables 6 & 7, respectively.

Prevalence and Characteristics of Patients with Incidental Thyroid Findings

Among 115,683 patients, we identified 9,077 (7.8%) with an ITF (Table 1). In unadjusted analyses, ITFs
were more frequent in women, older adults, and patients undergoing chest or neck imaging.
Socioeconomic differences were also observed, with higher prevalence among patients with Medicare and
lower prevalence among those with Medicaid or reported financial hardship. CT was the most common
modality for detecting ITFs, although nuclear medicine and PET studies demonstrated higher crude odds
of detection.

In multivariable analysis (Figure 2, Supplemental Table 8), several factors remained independently
associated with ITFs. Women had nearly twice the odds compared with men (OR, 1.83; 95% CI, 1.75—
1.92). Age was a strong predictor, with a 9.5% increase in odds per 5-year increment (OR, 1.09; 95% CI,
1.09—1.10). Higher BMI modestly increased risk (OR, 1.03 per 5-unit increment; 95% CI, 1.01—1.04).


===== PAGE BREAK =====

Ordering a specialty was a key determinant. Compared with emergency medicine, orders from oncology
(medical oncology: OR, 2.12; 95% CI, 1.90—2.37; hematology-oncology: OR, 2.05; 95% CI, 1.86—2.27
and internal medicine: OR, 1.64; 95% CI, 1.49-1.81, were most strongly associated with ITFs.

Modality and body region were highly associated with ITF detection and demonstrated a significant
interaction (Supplemental Figure 4). Compared with a CT of the chest, a CT of the neck was 3.4 times
more likely to detect an ITF (OR, 3.41; 95% CI, 3.20—3.63). This effect was even more pronounced with
other modalities: a PET scan of the neck had 4.8 times the odds, and a nuclear medicine scan of the neck
had over 25 times the odds of detecting an ITF (OR, 4.83; 95% CI, 1.32-17.89 and OR, 25.54; 95% CI,
9.77-66.00, respectively). Conversely, neck imaging via MRI (OR, 0.27; 95% CI, 0.10—0.75) and
ultrasound (OR, 0.12; 95% CI, 0.02—0.83) was associated with lower odds compared to chest CT. Head
imaging consistently showed lower odds of ITF detection across all modalities relative to chest CT. For
chest imaging specifically, PET (OR, 5.90; 95% CI, 3.74—9.30) and nuclear medicine (OR, 3.07; 95% CI,
2.05—4.58) had higher odds of ITF detection than CT, whereas other modalities had lower odds.

Radiologic Characteristics and Recommendations for Incidental Thyroid Nodules

Among the 9,077 patients with an ITF, 8,426 (92.9%) had findings classified as ITNs (Table 2). Nodule
location was the most frequently reported feature, documented in 6,504 cases (77.2%); the right lobe was
most common (38.2%), followed by the left lobe (34.6%) and bilateral nodules (27.0%). Nodule size was
reported in 3,689 cases (43.8%), with a mean diameter of 1.6 cm (SD, 1.2). Most nodules measured 1.1—
2.0 cm (40.6%) or <1.0 cm (38.0%).

Other radiologic features were described far less often. Calcifications were reported in 14.3% of cases,
while density (14.0%), attenuation (11.1%), and metabolic activity (8.9%) were infrequently documented.
When present, nodules were most often described as low density (92.9%) or low attenuation (90.8%).
Among reports noting metabolic activity, nearly half characterized it as ambiguous or unclear (46.9%).
All reports mentioning calcifications simply recorded their presence (100%).

Radiologist recommendations were included in 26.7% of reports. When provided, follow-up ultrasound
was most frequently advised (70.5%), followed by non-ultrasound imaging (10.0%) or other
recommendations (19.5%).

Clinical Outcomes Following Incidental Findings

A follow up thyroid ultrasound was ordered in 20.2% (1,830) of patients with ITFs. A post-index thyroid
nodule diagnosis was ascertained in 2,026 of 9,077 patients with an ITF (22.3%) compared with 676 of
106,606 patients without an ITF (0.6%). This led to a significant increase in downstream procedures.
Patients with an ITF had substantially higher odds of undergoing thyroid biopsy (6.1% vs 0.1%; OR,
46.8; 95% CI, 39.0-56.2) and were more likely to receive a partial (OR, 87.6; 95% CI, 49.1—-156.5) or
total thyroidectomy (OR, 55.8; 95% CI, 31.3—99.3). Although a diagnosis of thyroid cancer remained
uncommon overall, it occurred far more often among patients with an ITF: 109 cases (1.2%) compared
with 21 cases (0.02%) in those without ITFs, corresponding to over 60-fold higher odds of cancer
detection (OR, 61.7; 95% CI, 38.6—-98.5) (Table 3).

Among patients with ITFs who were diagnosed with thyroid cancer, 96 of 109 cases (88.1%) were
papillary thyroid carcinoma, 6 (5.5%) were oncocytic cell carcinoma, 4 (3.7%) were medullary, and 2
(1.8%) were follicular (Supplemental Table 9). By comparison, cancers detected in patients without ITFs


===== PAGE BREAK =====

were also predominantly papillary (19 of 21 cases, 90.5%), with only isolated cases of anaplastic (n=1,
4.8%) and oncocytic cell carcinoma (n=1, 4.8%). The mean tumor size was larger among cancers in the
ITF group (19.7 mm; SD, 14.4) compared with those in the non-ITF group (12.8 mm; SD, 7.8; P=
0.0499).

DISCUSSION

In this large, multisite cohort of 115,683 adults undergoing imaging for non-thyroid indications, ITFs
were common, present in 7.8%, nearly 1 in 13 patients. Most ITFs represented nodular disease (92.9%).
Approximately one-fifth of patients with ITFs proceeded to a dedicated thyroid ultrasound, marking the
first step of a pronounced diagnostic cascade: compared with patients without ITFs, those with ITFs had
markedly higher odds of biopsy, thyroidectomy, and receipt of a thyroid cancer diagnosis. Most cancers
detected were small papillary thyroid carcinomas, reinforcing concerns that incidental detection
predominantly uncovers low-risk disease.

Our prevalence aligns closely with the 8.3% pooled estimate from a recent meta-analysis, providing
external validation for our NLP-based methodology. However, the rate of follow-up thyroid ultrasound in
our cohort (~20%) was lower than the 34.9% reported in pooled data.* This discrepancy likely reflects a
combination of institutional practice norms, patient comorbidity burden, and variations in reporting
culture. It illustrates that recognition of an incidentaloma does not uniformly translate into cascade
initiation but is instead filtered through local practice patterns and patient context.

When cascades were triggered, however, the effect was substantial: patients with ITFs had >40-fold
higher odds of biopsy and >60-fold higher odds of a thyroid cancer diagnosis compared with those
without ITFs. Prior studies similarly show that once identified, ITNs often prompt biopsy in up to one-
third of cases and surgery in 5%—10%, despite malignancy rates of only 2%—5% overall. In our study, the
malignancy rate was 1.2%, lower than prior estimates, yet the histologic profile was consistent—
dominated by papillary carcinomas <2 cm.*'* Taken together, these findings demonstrate that while entry
into the cascade is variable, once initiated it reliably channels patients toward the detection of small, low-
risk tumors, underscoring the central role of ITFs as a driver of thyroid cancer overdiagnosis in the United
States.

Multivariable modeling clarified the demographic and imaging determinants of ITFs detection. Female
sex and older age were strong predictors, consistent with the epidemiology of thyroid nodules.”4
Detection varied by modality and body region, with PET and nuclear studies showing the highest odds
and MRI the lowest, while neck imaging was far more likely than chest to yield an ITFs. These patterns
mirror the heterogeneity observed in prior single-center cohorts, where chest CT prevalence typically
ranged from 5—7% and neck CT estimates exceeded 15%.* Our results extend these observations by
demonstrating a significant modality-by-region interaction effect across a large, multi-institutional

population.

Real-world reporting of radiologic features was inconsistent. Only 44% of ITNs had a documented size,
and fewer than 15% had descriptors such as calcifications, density, or metabolic activity. This gap
parallels concerns raised in narrative reviews and the ACR white paper, which emphasize that CT and
MRI lack the fine-grained features of ultrasound.'®>° Our results show how reliance on incomplete

reporting forces clinicians to make cascade decisions based largely on size, a blunt tool that increases risk
of both over- and under-evaluation.”’

This study should be interpreted considering its limitations. First, although the cohort is large and drawn
from multiple sites, all data comes from a single healthcare system, and the patient population and
institutional practices may not be fully generalizable to other settings. Second, the variable quality of
documentation in radiology reports limited our ability to analyze which features most strongly predict
malignancy or downstream interventions, both a study limitation and a reflection of current reporting
practice. Third, although the NLP models performed well, misclassification is possible and could
modestly influence prevalence and outcome estimates. Finally, this analysis does not provide a definitive
characterization of incidental thyroid nodules; such work would require direct review of images rather
than radiology reports. By relying on radiologist documentation, our findings may underestimate the true
frequency of nodules and be biased toward those considered significant enough to report.

This study advances understanding of incidental thyroid findings by linking prevalence with downstream
outcomes, creating opportunities to study the drivers of cascade initiation, track trends over time, and
evaluate interventions across health systems and countries, provided the NLP pipeline is validated in
diverse reporting environments. Variation in follow-up ultrasound highlights the need to determine
whether limited use reflects appropriate restraint or missed opportunities for care. For practice, including
guideline development, these findings highlight the importance of standardized reporting; the creation of
a structured lexicon for CT and other cross-sectional imaging—analogous to the American College of
Radiology Thyroid Imaging Reporting and Data System (ACR TI-RADS) for ultrasound—could reduce
variability, facilitate international comparisons, and promote cascade-aware management.”*

By developing and deploying a high-performance NLP system, this study unlocked clinical insights from
unstructured radiology reports at scale. Incidental thyroid findings were common and, when acted upon,
strongly associated with a diagnostic cascade that predominantly uncovered small, low-risk papillary
carcinomas, providing large-scale evidence that ITFs are a primary driver of thyroid cancer
overdiagnosis. These findings highlight the urgent need for standardized reporting of cross-sectional
imaging and support efforts to reduce unnecessary diagnostic cascades while preserving detection of
clinically meaningful disease.

Description

Pre-Training Corpus

Key Features

BERT-base

Foundational version of BERT, designed to
capture deep contextual relationships within
text through bidirectional training. Used as a
baseline model in this study.

BooksCorpus and English
Wikipedia

General-purpose training; lacks
domain-specific pre-training for
medical text.

RoBERTa

An optimized version of BERT with improved
training parameters, such as removal of the
next-sentence prediction objective and use of
larger mini-batches and learning rates. Well-
suited for nuanced language comprehension
tasks.

Extended corpus including
books and English Wikipedia

Enhanced understanding of
language dynamics; lacks
biomedical-specific pre-training.

Medical-NER

A specialized model fine-tuned from DeBERTa,
which incorporates disentangled attention
mechanisms to better understand word
relationships. Specifically trained for
biomedical tasks using domain-specific
corpora.

PubMed dataset

Domain-specific training for
medical terminology and text
structure; excels in identifying
clinical entities within thyroid
radiology reports.
