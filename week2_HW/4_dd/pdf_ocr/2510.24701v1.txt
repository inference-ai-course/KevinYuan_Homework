Abstract

We present Tongyi DeepResearch, an agentic large language model, which
is specifically designed for long-horizon, deep information-seeking research

tasks. To incentivize autonomous deep research agency, Tongyi DeepResearch
is developed through an end-to-end training framework that combines agen-
tic mid-training and agentic post-training, enabling scalable reasoning and
information seeking across complex tasks. We design a highly scalable data
synthesis pipeline that is fully automatic, without relying on costly human
annotation, and empowers all training stages. By constructing customized
environments for each stage, our system enables stable and consistent interac-
tions throughout. Tongyi DeepResearch, featuring 30.5 billion total parameters,
with only 3.3 billion activated per token, achieves state-of-the-art performance
across a range of agentic deep research benchmarks, including Humanity’s Last
Exam, BrowseComp, BrowseComp-ZH, WebWalkerQA, xbench-DeepSearch,
FRAMES and xbench-DeepSearch-2510. We open-source the model, frame-
work, and complete solutions to empower the community.

1 Introduction

As we advance toward Artificial General Intelligence (AGI), the emergence of Deep Research agents offers
a promising paradigm for augmenting and potentially liberating human intellectual productivity. Deep
research is a new agentic capability that autonomously conducts multi-step reasoning and information
seeking on the internet for complex research tasks. It can be completed in tens of minutes, which would
otherwise require several hours for a human (OpenAI, 2025a; Claude Team, 2025; Grok Team, 2025;
Gemini Team, 2025). However, most deep research systems remain closed-source, and their intermediate
research processes are inaccessible. While the community has made preliminary explorations in this
area (Wu et al., 2025a; Li et al., 2025c; Tao et al., 2025), there is still a lack of a systematic methodology and
publicly available models that can be fully open-sourced and shared across the community.

In this work, we introduce Tongyi DeepResearch, opening the era of open-source AI researchers. Our
goal is to endow large language models (LLMs) with autonomous research capabilities agency, the ability
to plan, search, reason, and synthesize knowledge across extended sequences of actions and diverse
information sources.

Tongyi DeepResearch delivers several key advancements:

¢ We propose an end-to-end agentic training paradigm that unifies agentic mid-training and agentic
post-training, forming a scalable foundation for deep reasoning and information-seeking behaviors.
Agentic mid-training cultivates inherent agentic biases by exposing the model to large-scale, high-
quality agentic data, serving as a progressive transition from pre-training to post-training stages.
Agentic post-training further unlocks the model’s potential via scalable multi-turn reinforcement
learning on a strong base model. Together, they enable the model to gradually develop from basic
interaction skills to advanced autonomous research behaviors.

¢ We design a fully automated, highly scalable data synthesis pipeline that eliminates human annota-
tion while generating diverse, high-quality agent trajectories. We design stage-specific data synthesis
strategies tailored to the objectives of each training phase, ensuring that every stage is supported
by appropriately structured and targeted data. Synthetic data is highly scalable, fast to validate,
and enables the construction of super-human-level datasets with stable distributions. It serves as an
indispensable engine for agent training.

¢ We construct stage-specific, customized environments that rely on robust infrastructure to deliver
consistent interactions for data synthesis across training stages. These environments allow the agent to
engage in rich, specialized interactions that are tightly aligned with its developmental stage. They can
take various forms, from prior world models to simulated environments and real-world interactive
contexts.

Tongyi DeepResearch establishes a new state-of-the-art with substantially fewer parameters, comprising
a total of 30.5 billion parameters while activating only 3.3 billion per token, building upon the Qwen3-
30B-A3B-Base model (Yang et al., 2025). Empirical evaluations on deep research benchmarks demonstrate
the effectiveness of our agent. Tongyi DeepResearch reaches 32.9 on Humanity’s Last Exam, 43.4
on BrowseComp, 46.7 on BrowseComp-ZH, 72.2 on WebWalkerQA, 70.9 on GAIA, 75.0 on xbench-
DeepSearch, 90.6 on FRAMES and 55.0 on xbench-DeepSearch-2510, outperforming strong baselines
such as OpenAI-o3 (OpenAI, 2025b) and Deepseek-V3.1 (DeepSeek Team, 2025). We also provide a
systematic analysis covering agentic reinforcement learning, synthetic data, offering key insights into the
development of deep research agent. In addition, we present the performance of Tongyi DeepResearch
on general benchmarks, including AIME25, HMMT25 and SimpleQA. We believe that agentic models
represent an emerging trend for the future, as models increasingly internalize agent-like capabilities and
can autonomously invoke the appropriate tools to solve a wide range of problems.

In the following sections, we first outline the design principles underlying Tongyi DeepResearch. We
then describe the training pipeline, followed by a comprehensive evaluation of its performance. We

release the model, framework, and end-to-end solutions to support and accelerate community research.
This technical report summarizes our main insights and aims to inspire further progress toward scalable
and capable agentic systems.

2 Design Principle

Agent Training Pipeline. Agent training is inherently more complex and challenging than conventional
LLM training. We introduce two stages in our agent training pipeline: mid-training and post-training.
We integrate mid-training directly into the deep research training process, and co-design the end-to-end
on-policy reinforcement learning algorithm and its underlying infrastructure for seamless scalability
and stability. While most work only applies post-training phase for DeepResearch agents, we novelly
introduce mid-training for agentic learning. General foundation models usually lack agentic inductive
bias. Most general foundation models are typically pretrained on plain text crawled from the internet and
then post-trained on instruction-following data. These datasets lack research-level questions and agentic
behaviors, resulting in the model learns agentic capabilities and alignment simultaneously during the
post-training phase. Agentic post-training on these general foundation models can result in sub-optimal
outcomes and inherent optimization conflicts. Mid-training endows the pre-trained base model with
substantial agentic prior knowledge, thereby bridging the gap between pretraining and agentic post-
training. Mid-training phase provides a powerful agentic foundation model to support effective agentic
post-training. During post-training, the model further internalizes deep research capabilities through
reinforcement learning with supervised fine-tuning (SFT) for cold start. SFT teaches the model to reliably
imitate curated demonstrations, establishing a stable behavioral baseline for research workflows and tool
use. However, behavior cloning alone tends to produce mimicry without exploration. RL closes the loop
with the environment, using reward signals to refine policies and to internalize agentic planning and
execution. In particular, reinforcement learning (1) explores optimal strategies through active interaction
with the environment; (2) internalizes goal-directed planning and execution capabilities; and 3) achieves
superior sample efficiency by prioritizing high-reward behaviors. The agent first acquires general agentic
pattern during supervised fine-tuning phase, while reinforcement learning phase effectively pushes the
limits of its agentic performance.

Synthetic Data Centric Scaling. Data serves as the foundation of training, while collecting data for
DeepResearch problems is extremely hard. Deep research problems require agents’ capability of connect-
ing information, reasoning across sources and validating conclusions. Unlike pre-training data, which
is naturally abundant, and conventional LLM post-training data, which is relatively easy to annotate,
agentic data is inherently scarce. Research-level problems are difficult to obtain through natural texts
from the web. Manually annotating these problems and agentic trajectories is extremely time-consuming
and costly (Wei et al., 2025). Building on the aforementioned agent training pipeline, agentic mid-training
requires large-scale, diverse trajectories to align subsequent agent behaviors, while agentic post-training
depends on high-quality, verifiable data to provide reliable reward signals. As a result, it is hard to
rely on natural data to scale DeepResearch capability. Therefore, we focus on synthetic data with large
language models. Synthetic data contains several advantages over human annotations below:

¢ Synthesizing research-level questions is easy to scale. We can use LLMs to synthesize question-
answer pair efficiently compared to manually annotating.

¢ The pattern and diversity are easy to generalize. LLMs are easy to understand the structure of hard
problems and usually have rare insight into diverse patterns, while training annotators to understand
the structure and patterns for research-level problems is time-consuming.

¢ Synthesized data enables targeted meta-capability enhancement. By decomposing complex agent
tasks into fundamental meta-capabilities (e.g., planning, information synthesis, memory management),
we can generate synthetic data that specifically targets and strengthens individual agent skills.

¢ Synthesized data can be verified easily. It is much easier than finding the solution to the question,


===== PAGE BREAK =====

which is essential in human annotating.

¢ Synthesized data can provide data flywheels in training stages. After one round of the agentic
training pipeline, the trained agentic model can generate synthesized data with stronger reasoning
and planning patterns. Data flywheel makes the agentic model evolve iteratively.

Based on these insights, we believe synthetic agentic data becomes the key to scaling deep-research
agents. The synthetic data in all phases of the agentic training pipeline are designed in three steps: (1)
synthesizing research-level questions; (2) Generating agentic behavior data; (3) Utilizing agentic data in
training pipeline.

Learning Through Environmental Interaction. Environmental interaction plays a crucial role in agent
intelligence emergence (Silver & Sutton, 2025). However, relying solely on real-world environments for
the whole agent training stage faces fundamental challenges: (1) Non-stationarity. The dynamic nature
of environments causes continuous distribution shift in training data, undermining learning stability;
(2) Interaction cost. The tangible expense of each API call makes large-scale exploration economically
prohibitive. These barriers render agent capability acquisition from the real world alone a formidable
endeavor.

In Tongyi DeepResearch, we propose a fundamental reframing: environments should not be passively viewed
as external reality, but actively designed as systems deeply coupled with the training process. Specifically, we
model environments into three forms, each striking a distinct balance between stability, fidelity, and cost:

¢ Prior World Environment. This environment provides task elements, tools, and state definitions,
allowing agents to autonomously mine interaction trajectories based on pretrained knowledge without
receiving actual environmental responses. It offers perfect stability, zero interaction cost, and unlimited
scalability, but lacks real-world feedback signals.

¢ Simulated Environment. This environment constructs controlled, reproducible replicas of real-world
interactions locally. It provides stability, rapid response, and low cost, enabling fast iteration and
causal attribution analysis. However, its data coverage is inherently limited, exhibiting a notable
sim-to-real gap.

¢ Real-world Environment. This environment delivers the most authentic data distribution and
feedback signals, serving as the ultimate proving ground for agent capabilities. Its advantage lies in
absolute distributional fidelity; the cost is expensive interactions, significant non-stationarity, and
exploration risks.

Building on this environmental insight, we adopt adaptive strategies for synthetic data generation
and training. Specifically, (1) During agentic mid-training, we primarily leverage the Prior World
Environment and Simulated Environment to generate large-scale synthetic data at minimal cost, ensuring
efficient agentic ability bootstrapping; (2) During agentic post-training, we validate training strategies
and algorithmic techniques in the simulated environment, then deploy verified optimal policies to the
real environment for final training. The choice of environments plays a crucial role, agentic intelligence
emerges not from a single wolrd, but from carefully chosen environments.

Agent training fundamentally depends on synthetic data and environment interaction. Based on these
design principles, we then introduce Tongyi DeepResearch in detail below.

3. Tongyi DeepResearch
3.1 Formulation

We formally define the Tongyi DeepResearch’s rollout at each timestep f through three fundamental
components:

¢ Thought (7;): The internal cognitive process of the agent. This includes analyzing the current context,


===== PAGE BREAK =====

recalling information from memory, planning subsequent steps, and engaging in self-reflection to
adjust its strategy.

¢ Action (a;): An external operation executed by the agent to interact with its environment. Tongyi
DeepResearch is equipped with a versatile set of tools that define its action space, enabling it to
interact with a wide range of information sources: Search, Visit, Python Interpreter, Google Scholar and
File Parser. Actions encompass all intermediate tool calls and the final response to the user. In a given
trajectory, intermediate actions (a; where ¢t < T) are tool calls, while the final action, a7, constitutes
the generation of an in-depth report for the user.

© Observation (0;): The feedback received from the environment after an action is performed. This new
information is used to update the agent’s internal state and inform its next thought.

Based on the fundamental components above, we define two different rollout types as follows:

ReAct. Tongyi DeepResearch’s architecture is fundamentally based on the vanilla ReAct (Yao et al.,
2023) framework, which synergizes reasoning and acting. In this paradigm, the agent generates both
a reasoning trace (Thought) and a subsequent Action in an interleaved manner. This process forms a
trajectory, Hy, which is a sequence of thought-action-observation triplets:

where ary represents the final answer to the given task. At any given step t < T, the agent’s policy, 7,
generates the current thought t and action a; based on the history of all previous interactions, H4-1:

Tr, a ~ 7(-|Hy_1).                                         (2)
While more complex single and multi-agent paradigms have emerged, our choice of ReAct is a deliberate
one, rooted in its simplicity and alignment with fundamental principles. This decision is informed by
"The Bitter Lesson" (Sutton, 2019), which posits that general methods leveraging scalable computation
ultimately outperform approaches that rely on complex, human-engineered knowledge and intricate
designs. Frameworks that require extensive, specialized prompt engineering or possess rigid operational
structures risk becoming obsolete as the intrinsic capabilities of models scale (Li et al., 2025a).

Context Management. The execution of long-horizon tasks is fundamentally constrained by the finite
length of the agent’s context window. To mitigate the risk of context overflow and ensure task focus,
we propose the context management paradigm (Qiao et al., 2025), which employs a dynamic context
management mechanism based on Markovian state reconstruction. Within this framework, the agent
is not conditioned on the complete history. Instead, at each step t, it is conditioned on a strategically
reconstructed workspace containing only essential elements: the question q, an evolving report S; serving
as compressed memory, and the immediate context from the last interaction (a; and o;). This Markovian
structure enables the agent to maintain consistent reasoning capacity across arbitrary exploration depths
while naturally circumventing the degradation. For every step 0 < ft < T, this core update process can be
formalized as:

St, T+1/4t41 ~ (-|Sp-1, at, 01).                                 (3)
This context management paradigm is particularly crucial, it not only prevents context suffocation
but also enforces structured reasoning by requiring the agent to explicitly synthesize and prioritize
information at each step. This design naturally aligns with human research patterns, where periodic
synthesis and reflection are essential for maintaining coherent long-term investigation.

3.2 Overall Training Recipe

The system is initialized from the pretrained base model Qwen3-30B-A3B-Base!. Tongyi DeepResearch
is developed through an end-to-end training framework that integrates agentic mid-training and post-
training, enabling scalable reasoning and information seeking across complex research tasks. This

establishes a new paradigm for training agentic models. We first present the mid-training process in
Section 3.3, followed by the post-training stage in Section 3.4.

3.3. Agentic Mid-training
3.3.1 Training Configuration

Tongyi DeepResearch employs a two-stage Agentic Continual Pre-training (Agentic CPT) (Su et al.,
2025) as its core mid-training phase. This phase functions as a critical bridge connecting pre-trained
models and agentic post-training. Its primary objective is to provide a base model endowed with a strong
inductive bias for agentic behavior, while simultaneously preserving broad linguistic competence. To
achieve this, the optimization process is driven by the standard Next-Token Prediction loss function.

The design of this phase is strategically optimized for both efficiency and progressive capability scaling.
We initiate with a 32K context length in the first stage, before expanding to 128K in the second. This
expanded context window is specifically leveraged in the second stage, where we introduce a substantial
corpus of long-sequence (64K-128K) agentic behavior data. This approach is critical for enhancing the
model’s capacity for coherent, long-horizon reasoning and action. Throughout both stages, a small
proportion of general pre-training data is interleaved, ensuring the model acquires specialized agentic
competence without sacrificing its foundational generalization capabilities.

Figure 3: Large-scale agent behavior data synthesis for agentic continual pre-training.

In Agentic CPT, we synthesize data across the complete lifecycle of agent workflows as shown in Figure 3.
A typical agent workflow begins with a problem, iteratively cycles through reflection and action, and
ultimately converges on a final solution. To comprehensively capture this process, we synthesize data
for the critical steps that constitute the agent’s operational cycle: Question Synthesis, Planning Action,
Reasoning Action, and Decision-Making Action. Note that while decision-making is often implicit within
agent cycles, we explicitly model it as a distinct action type in our synthesis framework.

Large-scale Multi-style Question Synthesis. Grounded in continuously updated open-world knowledge,
we construct an entity-anchored open-world memory. This memory consolidates diverse real-world
knowledge sources, such as web-crawled data and agent interaction trajectories, into structured represen-
tations of entities and their associated knowledge. Building upon this foundation, we sample entities
along with their related knowledge to generate diverse questions that embed specific behavioral pattern
requirements, such as multi-hop reasoning questions and numerical computation questions.


===== PAGE BREAK =====

Planning Action. Planning refers to problem decomposition and first-step action prediction. A key
insight is that planning accuracy is highly correlated with whether an agent can successfully complete a
task. Thus, we employ open-source models to analyze, decompose, and predict initial actions for the
synthesized questions. Furthermore, we leverage the entities and associated knowledge used in question
construction as the basis for rejection sampling, thereby ensuring high-quality planning outputs.

Reasoning Action. Logical reasoning and knowledge integration over heterogeneous data is foundational
for agents solving complex tasks. When external tools return massive unstructured responses, whether
models can distill critical knowledge from noise and construct coherent reasoning paths directly deter-
mines task outcomes. To this end, given a question and its dependent knowledge, we guide large models
through a two-stage process to generate complete reasoning chains, with a dual filtering mechanism
based on reasoning length and answer consistency to ensure quality.

Decision-Making Action. Each step of an agent’s thinking and action is essentially an implicit decision-
making process. Specifically, each decision point encompasses multiple potential reasoning and action
paths, from which the agent must select the most promising solution. To capture this critical mechanism,
we explicitly model this decision-making process. First, based on existing demonstration trajectories, we
thoroughly explore the feasible action space at each step. Second, we reconstruct the original trajectories
into multi-step decision sequences while preserving the original decision choices.

General Function-calling Data Synthesis via Environment Scaling. To enhance our model’s general
agentic capability, we systematically scale the function-calling data through environment scaling. The
breadth of function-calling competence is closely tied to the diversity of environments in which agents
are trained (Fang et al., 2025). We also scale up environments as a step towards advancing general
agentic intelligence. In designing environment construction and scaling, we follow the principle that
the core of an agent lies in its capacity for environment interaction, with each environment instantiated
as a read—write database. We design a scalable framework that automatically constructs heterogeneous
environments that are fully simulated, systematically broadening the space of function-calling scenarios.
The produced data are incorporated into the model’s mid-training phase.

3.4 Agentic Post-training

The post-training pipeline comprises three stages: data synthesis, supervised fine-tuning for cold start,
and agentic reinforcement learning.

(1) Graph Construction      (2) Subgraph Sampling      (3) Uncertainty Injection
Figure 4: High-quality data synthesis pipeline.

We develop an end-to-end solution for synthetic data generation to generate complex, high-uncertainty
and super-human level question and answer pairs (Li et al., 2025c;b), as shown in Figure 4. This
fully automated process requires no human intervention to construct super-human quality datasets,
designed to push the boundaries of agent performance. The process begins by constructing a highly
interconnected knowledge graph via random walks, leveraging web search to acquire relevant knowledge,
and isomorphic tables from real-world websites, ensuring a realistic information structure. We then


===== PAGE BREAK =====

sample subgraphs and subtables to generate initial questions and answers. The pivotal step involves
strategically increasing the uncertainty within the question to enhance its difficulty (Wu et al., 2025a).
This practical approach is grounded in a complete theoretical framework, where we formally model QA
difficulty as a series of controllable "atomic operations" (e.g., merging entities with similar attributes) on
entity relationships, allowing us to systematically increase complexity. To further reduce inconsistencies
between the organized information structure and the reasoning structure of QA, enable more controllable
difficulty and structure scaling of reasoning, we proposed a formal modeling of the information-seeking
problem based on set theory (Tao et al., 2025). With this formalization, we develop agents that expands the
problem in a controlled manner, and minimizes reasoning shortcuts and structural redundancy, leading
to further improved QA quality. Moreover, this formal modeling also allows for efficient verification of
QA correctness, effectively addressing the challenge of validating synthetic information-seeking data for
post-training.

We also develop an automated data engine to scale the generation of PhD-level research questions (Qiao
et al., 2025). Starting from a multi-disciplinary knowledge base, it creates seed QA pairs requiring
multi-source reasoning. These seeds undergo iterative complexity upgrades, where a question-crafting
agent, equipped with the corresponding tool, progressively expands scope and abstraction. Each iteration
refines and compounds prior outputs, enabling a systematic and controllable escalation of task difficulty.

3.4.2 Supervised Fine-tuning for Cold Start

The initial phase of our agentic post-training pipeline is a supervised fine-tuning (SFT) stage, designed
to equip the base model with a robust initial policy prior to reinforcement learning. Starting from
our synthesized high-quality QA data, we obtain training trajectories that cover the complete thought
process and tool responses generated by high-performing open-source models, which are then subjected
to a rigorous rejection sampling protocol. This comprehensive filtering process guarantees that only
high-quality trajectories exhibiting diverse problem-solving patterns are retained.

Mixed Training Paradigm. The cold stage training leverages data from two different formulations
to enhance model robustness and generalization. For the React Mode, the training samples take the
historical state H;, as input, and output the corresponding thought 7; and tool call a; for the current step.
For our Context Management Mode , the training samples take as input the previous step’s trajectory
summary 5S;_;, tool call a;_;, and tool response 0;_;, and output the current step’s trajectory summary,
thought 7;, and tool call a;. The Context Management Mode data particularly strengthens the agent’s
capabilities in state analysis and strategic decision-making, as it requires the model to synthesize complex
observations into coherent summaries while maintaining task focus across extended trajectories. This
synthesis-oriented training enables more deliberate reasoning patterns compared to purely ReAct. We
adopt a two-stage training strategy based on context length. In the first stage, the context length is set to
40K, and the training data consist of ReAct Mode samples with context lengths shorter than 40K, along
with all Context Management Mode samples (as they are all within 40k). In the second stage, the context
length is extended to 128K, and the training data include ReAct Mode samples with context lengths
between 40K and 128K, as well as a small portion of 40K data for stability.

3.4.3 Agentic Reinforcement Learning

To advance the model’s capabilities toward more robust and reliable planning and searching in a complex
web environment, we apply an agentic RL framework, which is illustrated in Figure 5. In this framework,
the model generates a complete task attempt (a "rollout") and receives a reward if its final answer matches
the ground truth (RLVR) (Guo et al., 2025). Throughout this agentic RL procedure, the model continuously
interacts with the environment (simulated or real-world), iteratively refining its policy with each iteration,
and, in turn, using that improved policy to curate a new, higher-quality set of training data.

Real-world Environment. Our agent’s toolkit is a complex system that integrates several specialized
tools’: (1) Search, (2) Visit, (3) Python Interpreter, (4) Google Scholar, (5) File Parser. The end-to-end
reliability of this system is paramount. The inherent volatility of external APIs, encompassing high
latency, outright failures, and inconsistent returns, threatens to corrupt our training trajectories. This data
contamination makes it nearly impossible to diagnose performance issues, obscuring whether a poor
outcome is caused by a weakness in the agent’s policy or by the instability of the environment itself. To
ensure reliable tool use during agent training and evaluation, we developed a unified sandbox. This
interface is built around a central scheduling and management layer that orchestrates every tool call. For
each tool, we implement robust concurrency controls and fault-tolerance mechanisms, such as proactive
OPS rate constraints, result caching, automatic timeout-and-retry protocols, graceful service degradation
for non-critical failures, and seamless failover to backup data sources (e.g., a backup search API). This
design abstracts the tool invocation into a deterministic and stable interface for the agent and thereby
insulates the training loop from real-world stochasticity while also significantly reducing operational
costs. This design abstracts tool invocation into a deterministic interface, providing a stable and fast
experience that is crucial for preventing tool errors from corrupting the agent’s learning trajectory.

Simulated Environment. Directly utilizing real-world web environment APIs presents numerous
practical problems?. We first build an offline environment based on the 2024 Wikipedia database and
develop a suite of local RAG tools to simulate the web environment. We then reuse the data synthesis
pipeline to create a high-quality, structurally complex QA specifically for this offline environment. This
provides us with a low-cost, high-efficiency, and fully controllable platform that enables high-frequency,
rapid experimentation, thereby greatly accelerating our development and iteration process.

On-Policy Asynchronous Rollout Framework. The iterative nature of agentic rollouts, which require
numerous interactions with the environment, creates a significant bottleneck that slows down the entire
RL training process. To overcome this, we implement a custom, step-level asynchronous RL training
loop built on the rLLM framework (Tan et al., 2025). Our solution utilizes two separate asynchronous
online servers, with one for model inference and another for tool invocation. A centralized interaction
handler then processes the outputs from both, formatting the feedback into a unified message list. This
architecture allows multiple agent instances to interact with the environment in parallel, each completing
its rollout independently.

?The details for each tool are shown in Appendix D.
3 Queries per second (QPS) impact significantly degrade our development efficiency and compromise the reliability
during our early-stage ablation studies.

RL Training Algorithm. Our RL algorithm is a tailored adaptation of GRPO (Shao et al., 2024):

J (0) =  E gy) ~DA HS .~ 7094 (context)
1    G |x!         .                       ~         (4)

rs, a hd     ( ij )  ij   p( ij )     low     high)  ii)

where (q,y) is the question-answer pair, 7; ;(9) is the importance sampling ratio (remains 1.0 for strictly
on-policy training), and Aj; is an estimator of the advantage at token j:

7T@  (H. i
TO xia (HM

context       ~

r1,;(0) =

context)’

We employ a strict on-policy regimen, where trajectories are consistently sampled using the most up-
to-date policy, ensuring that the learning signal is always relevant to the model’s current capabilities.
The reward is a pure 0 or 1 signal of answer correctness. We do not include a format reward (e.g., 0.1
for format correctness) because the preceding cold start stage ensures the model is already familiar
with the required output format. Following DAPO (Yu et al., 2025), we apply the token-level policy
gradient loss in the training objective and clip-higher strategy to encourage more exploration. To further
reduce variance in the advantage estimation, we adopt a leave-one-out strategy (Chen et al., 2025).
Furthermore, we observed in preliminary experiments that directly optimizing on an unfiltered set of
negative rollouts significantly degrade training stability and can lead to policy collapse after extended
training. To mitigate this, we selectively exclude certain negative samples from the loss calculation,
for instance, those that do not yield a final answer because they exceed a length limit. The primary
motivation for these modifications is not algorithmic novelty but the pragmatic pursuit of a more efficient
and stable training paradigm.

Automatic Data Curation. We optimize data in real time, guided by training dynamics to generalize
to out-of-distribution scenarios through self-exploration. This optimization is achieved through a fully
automated data filtering pipeline that dynamically adjusts the training set based on the improved policy
model. Specifically, our process begins with a large dataset, D. We use the initial SFT model as a baseline
policy to sample multiple solution attempts, or rollouts, for each problem. We then create an initial
training set, D’, by filtering out problems where the model either always fails or always succeeds, as
these will offer no learning signal for RL training. This leaves us with a focused subset of problems of
moderate difficulty. During RL training, we continuously monitor the problems in D’ by their latest
rollouts to see if they have become too easy for the improved policy model. In parallel, a separate process
uses intermediate checkpoints of the policy model to sample from the entire original dataset, D. This
background process identifies and collects a backup pool of new problems that have become moderately
difficult for the now-stronger model. When the training reaches a certain step count or the reward
plateaus, we refresh the active training set D’ by removing the mastered problems and incorporating
new, challenging ones from the backup pool. The entire data filtering and refreshment pipeline runs
independently, never interrupting the main RL training loop. This design allows us to automatically
evolve both the policy model and its training data, ensuring consistently high training efficiency and
stability.

Through our experiments, we arrive at a critical insight: the success of agentic RL depends more on
the quality of the data and the stability of the training environment than on the specific algorithm
being used. Consequently, we concentrate our efforts on designing a stable environment and curating
high-quality data, making only a few essential modifications to the algorithm itself, mainly for the
purpose of stabilizing the training process.

3.4.4 Model Merging

We employ model merging at the last stage of the pipeline. This approach is built on the key insight that
when different model variants are derived from the same pre-trained model, their parameters can be
effectively combined through averaging or interpolation (Wang et al., 2025). Specifically, our process
involves selecting several model variants that originate from the same base model but exhibit different
capability preferences. We then create the final merged model by computing a weighted average of their
parameters:

Omerged = yo ag . a),   s.t.   yo ag =1,04,20.                           (6)
k                    k

where 6‘) represents the parameters of the k-th model variant, and a; is its corresponding merge weight.
Empirically, this interpolation strategy not only preserves the core strengths of each contributing model
but also equips the merged model with robust generalization abilities. In complex scenarios requiring a
synthesis of these varied capabilities, the merged model performs comparably to the best-performing
source model in its respective area of strength, all without incurring additional optimization costs.

4.1 Experimental Setup

Backbones. We evaluate Tongyi DeepResearch on seven public information-seeking benchmarks span-
ning long-term reasoning and long-horizon tool use. The model is compared against two families
of systems: 1) LLM-based ReAct agents: GLM-4.5 (Zeng et al., 2025), Kimi-K2 (Team et al., 2025),
DeepSeek-V3.1 (DeepSeek Team, 2025), Claude-4-Sonnet (anthropic, 2025), OpenAI 03/04-mini (Ope-
nAI, 2025b)) and 2) end-to-end deep-research agents: OpenAI DeepResearch (OpenAI, 2025a), Gemini
DeepResearch (Gemini Team, 2025), Kimi Researcher (Kimi, 2025).

tions: temperature = 0.85, repetition penalty = 1.1, and top-p = 0.95. A maximum of 128 tool invocations
is allowed per task, and the context length is constrained to 128K tokens. Each benchmark is evaluated
three times independently, and we report the average performance (Avg@3) as the main metric. For com-
pleteness, we also report the best Pass@1 (best result over 3 runs) and Pass@3 results in the subsequent
analysis. All results are obtained on September 16, 2025, except for xbench-DeepSearch-2510, which is
evaluated on October 28, 2025.

Figure 6: Performance comparison between Tongyi DeepResearch Heavy Mode and state-of-the-art
models.

To further unlock the potential of deep research agents, we introduce the Heavy Mode, which leverages
test-time scaling through a Research-Synthesis framework built upon the context management paradigm.
Given that DeepResearch involves multi-round tool calls and intensive reasoning, directly aggregating
contexts from multiple trajectories is computationally prohibitive. Our Heavy Mode addresses this
challenge through strategic parallelization and synthesis.

Parallel Research Phase. We deploy n parallel agents, each following the context management paradigm
but exploring diverse solution paths through different tool usage and reasoning strategies. Each agent u
independently processes the question q and produces a final report and answer:

(Sp,answer,) = Agent, (q),  u € [1,1]                            (7)

where S? represents the final report summary from agent u after T iterations, encapsulating the complete
reasoning trajectory in compressed form.

12


===== PAGE BREAK =====

Integrative Synthesis Phase. A synthesis model consolidates all parallel findings to produce the final
answer:
ansWeffinal = Synthesis ({(S7,answer,)}/_1),                              (8)

The key advantage of this approach lies in the compressed nature of context management reports S7.
Unlike traditional methods that would require aggregating full trajectories (potentially exceeding context
limits with just 2-3 agents), our approach enables the synthesis model to assess n diverse solution
strategies within a manageable context window. Each report S7 preserves the essential reasoning logic
and findings while discarding redundant intermediate steps, enabling effective test-time scaling.

As shown in Figure 6, our Heavy Mode achieves state-of-the-art performance on Humanity’s Last
Exam (38.3%) and BrowseComp-ZH (58.1%), while remaining highly competitive on BrowseComp
(58.3%). These substantial improvements validate the effectiveness of our heavy mode based on context
management in leveraging test-time compute through parallel exploration and intelligent aggregation.

Pass@1 and Pass@3 Performance. We report the Avg@3 performance in Table 1. Given the dynamic and
complex nature of agent environments, we further conduct a fine-grained analysis of Pass@1 (over three

are consistent with the Pass@1 (best result over 3 runs) results, demonstrating the robustness of our
deep research approach. Our Pass@3 performance demonstrates the strong potential of our agent. In

Training Rewards and Entropy. As shown in Figure 8, the agent’s performance exhibits a clear and
significant upward trend with training, confirming effective policy learning. The sustained nature of
this improvement underscores the success of our dynamic data curation, which prevents learning from
stagnating by consistently providing challenging material. Concurrently, the policy entropy exhibits
exceptional stability, converging to a consistent value after a brief initial increase and thereby avoiding
both collapse and explosion. This outcome serves as strong evidence for our methodological contributions
in environment design and algorithm modification, which together create the necessary conditions for a
remarkably stable and effective RL training paradigm.

Context Length of RL. In Figure 10, we analyze the impact of the model’s context length on the agentic
RL training process, comparing models with 32k, 48k, and 64k context limits. It is important to note

Figure 8: Reward and entropy loss of agentic RL training.

that the dynamic data curation for all three experimental variants was performed using the same model
with a 64k context. Focusing first on the reward dynamics in the left panel, we observe that all three
models demonstrate effective and stable policy learning, evidenced by a monotonically increasing reward.
This confirms the robustness of our training framework. However, their performance ceilings diverge
significantly, which is an expected consequence of our data curation method. Because the curriculum is
populated with problems deemed moderately difficult by the highly capable 64k context model, many of
these problems inherently require long and complex reasoning to solve. Consequently, a clear hierarchy
emerges: the 64k model, perfectly matched to its own data, achieves the highest reward. The 48k and 32k
models, being increasingly constrained, are unable to solve the most complex problems in the curriculum,
thus capping their maximum potential reward.

The training dynamics in the right panel reveal a more interesting story. The model with a 64k context
exhibits a steady increase in average response length, learning to leverage its expansive context to build
more elaborate solutions. In contrast, the model with a 48k context maintains a consistent equilibrium,
improving its policy within a stable complexity budget. Most surprisingly, the model with a 32k context
displays a clear downward trend in response length. This observation provides a key insight: for a model
with a limited context, RL training on a curriculum designed for a more capable model can force it to
discover more efficient solutions. This effect arises because our dynamic data curriculum is continuously
updated using the 64k context model, a process that populates the training set with problems whose
optimal solutions can be longer than 32k tokens. For the model with a 32k context, attempting these
problems is likely to yield a zero-reward signal. This creates a powerful implicit incentive to discover
more concise, potent action sequences that fit within its limit, thus becoming more efficient over time.

interaction turns with the environment is crucial. While reasoning models can be scaled by increasing the
number of output tokens, our approach scales along a different dimension, the number of environment
interactions. Naturally, as the number of interactions increases, the agent obtains more observations
from environment, resulting in a longer context. Figure 10a illustrates our scaling curve: as the context
length and number of interactions grow, the model’s performance on the BrowseComp dataset improves
consistently.

Super-human Level Synthetic Data. To validate the effectiveness of our synthetic data, we conducted
a Statistical analysis of the SFT dataset. Over 20% of the samples exceed 32k tokens and involve more
than 10 tool invocations. This demonstrates the high complexity and richness of our synthetic data. Such
high-quality, cold-start data provides the model with a strong foundation for deep reasoning and research
capabilities, serving as an excellent initialization for the RL phase. During reinforcement learning, we
leverage automated data curation to make more effective use of the synthetic data.

From Simulation to Reality. To rapidly validate our algorithm, we built a simulated Wiki environment
that mirrors real-world conditions. We test our adapted GRPO algorithm in this environment, and the
resulting reward curve, shown in Figure 10b, closely matches the one observed in the real environment, as
shown in Figure 8. This Wiki simulation environment provides functionality analogous to a "wind tunnel
laboratory", enabling fast algorithm iteration and significantly improved our development efficiency.

5 Discussion

===== PAGE BREAK =====

5.1 Limitations

We acknowledge several limitations in our current work: First, the current 128K context length re-
mains insufficient for handling the most complex long-horizon tasks, motivating further exploration
of extended context windows or more advanced context management mechanisms (Qiao et al., 2025;
Wu et al., 2025c). Second, we have not yet released a larger-scale model. Although the smaller-sized
model already demonstrates strong performance, a larger model is currently in progress. Third, we are
continuously improving report generation fidelity and optimizing for user preferences to ensure more
faithful, useful, and preference-aligned outputs (Li et al., 2025e). Fourth, we aim to improve the efficiency
of our reinforcement learning framework by exploring techniques such as partial rollouts, which will
require addressing off-policy training challenges, including distributional shift. Finally, our current Deep
Research training focuses on specific prompt instructions and predefined tool sets. We plan to enhance
its robustness and extend the framework from Deep Research to broader agentic tool use scenarios.

5.2 Model Scale

We believe that training agentic capabilities on relatively small models is highly valuable (Belcak et al.,
2025). Smaller models are inherently more efficient to deploy on edge devices, broaden accessibility
across diverse real-world scenarios, and deliver faster, more responsive interactions. This direction aligns
with the broader goal of making autonomous research agents both powerful and practically deployable.

5.3. What’s Next

We have a long-standing commitment to advancing research and development in deep research agents.
The Tongyi DeepResearch represents a significant step toward AI systems capable of autonomously
transforming information into insight. We advocate for open-source models with emergent agency, which
are essential for democratizing agentic intelligence and deepening our fundamental understanding of
how agency can emerge and scale in open systems. Looking ahead, we aim to evolve from domain-specific
agents to general-purpose agents, which are capable of reasoning, planning, and acting autonomously
across diverse domains with minimal human supervision. To achieve this, we are developing the next-
generation agent foundation model, a unified model designed to endow AI systems with scalable
reasoning, memory, and autonomy, enabling them to operate as truly general agents. We believe it will
empower individuals and organizations to reach new heights of productivity and innovation.

6 Conclusion

We introduced Tongyi DeepResearch, an open-source deep research agent that unifies agentic mid-
training and post-training into a scalable, end-to-end paradigm. Through automated data synthesis
and stage-specific environments, the model learns to plan, search, reason, and synthesize information
autonomously. Despite its efficiency, activating only 3.3B parameters, Tongyi DeepResearch achieves
state-of-the-art results on multiple deep research benchmarks, surpassing strong proprietary systems.
This work establishes a foundation for open, reproducible research into autonomous AI agents and marks
a step toward more general, self-improving intelligence.

The above constitutes the system prompt of our ReAct rollout.
B Evaluation Details

For GAJA and WebWalkerQA, following the evaluation protocol of Li et al. (2025d), we adopt Qwen2.
5-72B-Instruct as the judging model. The evaluation prompt is kept identical to that used in their
work to ensure consistency and comparability. For xbench-DeepSearch and xbench-DeepSearch-2510, we
adopt Gemini-2.0-Flash-001 as the judge model. For BrowseComp and BrowseComp-ZH, we employ
GPT-40-2024-08-06 as the judge model. For Humanity’s Last Exam, we evaluate the 2,154 text-only
questions following Chai et al. (2025). The evaluation prompt follows the official protocol, with the
03-mini serving as the evaluator. The evaluation prompt for these benchmarks is kept consistent with
that described in the original paper to ensure alignment and reproducibility. The evaluation prompts
used for each benchmark is provided in detail on our GitHub repository”.

For general benchmarks, we adopt different evaluation strategies based on task type. For mathematical
problems, since our system outputs a detailed report and datasets such as AIME25 and HMMT25 are
relatively small in scale, we employ manual evaluation to ensure accuracy and fairness. For knowledge-
based problems, we utilize the official evaluation script of SimpleQA to maintain consistency with
established benchmarks.

C_ Post-training Synthetic Data Case

Question:

A military officer, who also served as governor in a western North American territory,
commanded a mounted infantry unit during a period of significant mineral discovery in

the region. His official report on the discovery prompted the minting of a special
commemorative coin in a certain year in the mid-19th century. During that same year,

the unit he commanded was involved in a military conflict against a neighboring country.
Just over a decade later, this unit was officially redesignated and would be assigned to a
new division in the early 1920s. In the 1930s, this redesignated regiment was involved in
an organizational swap. Which other regiment was it exchanged for?

Answer:

12th Cavalry Regiment

Question:

An 18th-century travelogue, later adapted for a radio series, describes a port town in
southeastern England as notable for its rampant illicit trade. This town was also the
home of a 16th-century gentleman whose murder led to his wife’s execution. Centuries
later, another resident of the same town was granted letters patent providing special
commercial privileges in a particular year of the early 19th century. During that same
year, a collector, whose large collection of manuscript poems was later auctioned, secured
a patent for a method of grinding inks. In that year, a patent of nobility was issued to
a German family; what is the German term for the princely status it conferred?

Answer:

Fiirstenstand

Question:

In trisilylamine (N(SiH3)3), the Si-N bond length is 1.736 A. Substituting one silyl
group with methyl to form (CH3)N(SiH3)2 elongates the Si-N bond to 1.752 A. Calculate the
percentage increase in bond length due to diminished hyperconjugation, and identify which
specific orbital interaction weakens most significantly. Use covalent radii: Si=1.11 A,
N=0.70 A, c=0.77 A.

The first two cases above are synthetically generated high-quality, high-uncertainty, superhuman ques-
tion—answer pairs, examples of a caliber that is exceptionally difficult to produce via human annotation.
The third case represents a PhD-level research question, demanding deep domain expertise, multi-step
reasoning.

Environment Details

We utilize five tools for Tongyi DeepResearch, namely Search, Visit, Python Interpreter, Google Scholar,

and File Parser

6;

Search leverages the Google search engine for information retrieval. The tool accepts a list of one or
more search queries to be executed concurrently. For each query, it returns the top-10 ranked results,
with each result comprising a title, a descriptive snippet, and its corresponding URL.

Visit is designed for targeted information extraction from web pages. The tool takes as input a set
of web pages, where each page is paired with a dedicated information-seeking goal. The process
begins by employing Jina (Jina.ai, 2025) to parse the full content of a given web page. Subsequently, a
summary model processes this content to extract only the information pertinent to that page’s specific
goal.

Python Interpreter is used to execute Python code within a sandboxed environment. The input is a
string of Python code, which must be enclosed within <code> tags for proper execution. The tool runs
the provided code and captures its standard output; therefore, any results or values intended to be
seen must be explicitly passed to the print() function. This capability enables dynamic computation,
data manipulation, and the use of various Python libraries in a secure and isolated manner.

Google Scholar is used to retrieve information from academic publications. The input consists of a
list of one or more search queries, allowing for multiple, distinct searches within a single tool call. The
tool leverages the Google Scholar search engine to execute each query and gather relevant scholarly
literature, such as articles, papers, and citations.

File Parser answers user queries by analyzing a mix of documents, web pages, and multimedia files
(e.g., PDF, DOCX, MP4) from local or URL sources. It works in two steps: first, it converts all input
into plain text, transcribing audio/video content when necessary. Second, a summary model reads
this unified text to generate a direct answer to the user’s question

6Since our system relies on several internal APIs and fallback strategies (as described in Section 3.4.3), we provide

alternative open implementations in our open-source GitHub repository to facilitate public use. We have verified
through extensive testing that these substitutions can faithfully reproduce our results.
