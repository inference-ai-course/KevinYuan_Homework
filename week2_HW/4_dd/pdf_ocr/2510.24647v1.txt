Abstract

We ask where, and under what conditions, dyslexic reading costs arise in a large-scale
naturalistic reading dataset. Using eye-tracking aligned to word-level properties—word
length, frequency, and predictability—we model the influence of each of these features on
dyslexic time costs. We find that all three properties robustly change reading times in both
typical and dyslexic readers, but dyslexic readers show stronger sensitivities to each of the
three features, especially predictability. Counterfactual manipulations of these features
substantially narrow the dyslexic—control gap—by about one-third—with predictability
showing the strongest effect, followed by length, and frequency. These patterns align with
existing dyslexia theories suggesting heightened demands on linguistic working memory and
phonological encoding in dyslexic reading and directly motivate further research into lexical
complexity and preview benefits to further explain the quantified gap. In effect, these
findings break down when extra dyslexic costs arise, how large they are, and provide
actionable guidance for the development of interventions and computational models for
dyslexic readers.

Why Dyslexic Reading Takes Longer — And When

Dyslexia is characterized by persistent difficulty in accurate and/or fluent word
recognition and decoding (Lyon et al., 2003) and affects between 4—8% of individuals (Yang
et al., 2022; Doust et al., 2022). A robust behavioural signature of this condition, observable
well into adolescence and adulthood, is a disproportionate slowdown during reading.
Dyslexic readers make more eye fixations, those fixations last longer, and they skip words
less often than typically developing peers (Hy6na & Olson, 1995; Hutzler & Wimmer, 2004;
De Luca et al., 2002). This global pattern has been documented across orthographies and age
groups, in large reviews and targeted studies, using connected text, word- and pseudoword
lists (Rayner, 1998; Hutzler & Wimmer, 2004; Hawelka et al., 2010). Yet, despite consensus
on the existence of a dyslexia slowdown, we still lack process-linked, interpretable markers
that explain why these time costs occur, when in processing they arise, and how much they
contribute to the dyslexic—control gap in reading times. The core aim of this study is thus to
establish a transparent, word-level account of where this time accumulates for dyslexic
readers.

During sentence reading, the eyes alternate between brief pauses (fixations) and rapid
jumps (saccades). In cognitive research, these two basic measures are often further broken
down into skipping, first-fixation duration, and total (per word) reading time, each of which
indexes a different cognitive process. Skipping (the binary decision to fixate a word or not)
indexes very early signs of ease during word identification. If a person consistently skips
words, this reflects successful visual preview and/or strong contextual expectation about
upcoming word identities (Schotter, Angele, & Rayner, 2012; Rayner & Well, 1996) — both
signs of an experienced reader and/or simpler text (Rayner, 1998; Slattery et al., 2018).

Appropriately, skipping rates typically rise when words are short, frequent, and predictable

(Rayner et al., 2011; Schotter, Angele, & Rayner, 2012) as well as for more experienced, and
older readers (Rayner, 1998; Reichle et al., 2013; Slattery et al., 2018).

First-fixation duration (FFD), the second eye-measure, refers to the earliest foveal
processing on an encountered word and is commonly interpreted as tracking initial lexical
access to a word (Staub, 2015; Reichle, Rayner, & Pollatsek, 2003). Thus, longer FFDs on a
word can index increased difficulties with initial word processing: either due to difficulties
identifying the word or integrating it with its prior context (Clifton, Staub, & Rayner, 2007;
Staub, 2015). In typical adult readers, FFDs reliably shorten for high-frequency and highly
predictable words, reflecting facilitation at the initial lexical-access stage enabled by these
word features (Rayner, 1998; Rayner et al., 2011; Staub, 2015).

Finally, total reading time (TRT) sums all fixations on a word, including any second-
pass re-readings. While FFD and TRT are similar, increases in TRT also indicate extended
processing—such as integration demands or reanalysis (Klieg]l et al., 2004; Clifton, Staub, &
Rayner, 2007; Staub, 2015). This means TRT is more sensitive to the overall speed of word
and context processing of a reader than FFD. TRT is especially sensitive to integration and
reanalysis costs that increase with syntactic-memory load (Gibson, 1998; Boston et al., 2008),
making it a useful index of later-stage “integration” processes throughout reading.

Taken together, skipping, FFD, and TRT provide a clear division in reading
mechanisms: skipping asks whether a word needs foveal time at all (measuring preview and
identification success), while FFD and TRT ask how much time is required for processing a
word in context (focusing more on word identification and integration demand measures,
respectively).

Building on these distinct measures, three word-level properties moderate whether a
word is fixated at all (skipped) and, if fixated, how long early (FFD) and extended (TRT)

processing takes. These are word length, lexical frequency, and contextual predictability. The

first of these, word length, affects reading times by directly changing how much of a word
falls within the high-acuity vision of the fovea; the longer a word is, the more of it
(necessarily) spills into parafoveal regions where visual crowding processes make letter
identification less reliable and word identity less certain (Schotter & Leinenger, 2016; Pelli &
Tillman, 2008 Juhasz et al., 2008). This reduces the odds of one-shot recognition (processing
a word using just one fixation) and increases the need for serial (letter-by-letter) fixation to
recognize the word (Pelli & Tillman, 2008), both of which increase reading times. Empirical
research demonstrates these effects by linking increased word length with decreases in
skipping rates, and increased FFD and TRTs (Kliegl et al., 2004; Rayner et al., 2011; Tiffin-
Richards & Schroeder, 2015), with effects that remain even after controlling for other factors
like frequency and predictability (Kliegl et al., 2004; Rayner et al., 2011).

Lexical frequency, our second moderator, quantifies how common a word is ina
language (and thus, how likely a reader is to know and recognize it). Frequent words
commonly have more entrenched lexical representations (Perfetti, 2007) (i.e. pathways
towards the retrieval of key information about the word), so mapping from initial viewing
through to retrieval of the word’s phonological and semantic code is faster and more reliable.
Within computational accounts of eye-movement control, frequency most strongly affects the
“familiarity check” stage (the stage at which you decide if you know a word), predicting
shorter first fixations (lower FFD) and reducing the need for extensive word processing
(lower TRT) for frequent words (Reichle, Rayner, & Pollatsek, 2003). Empirically, higher
frequency words reflect this, increasing skipping and shortening FFD (Rayner, 1998;
Pollatsek et al., 2008); when fixated, frequent words also reduce late measures such as TRT,
by imposing fewer integration challenges requiring regressions back to the word (Rayner et

al., 2004; Tiffin-Richards & Schroeder, 2015).

Contextual predictability, our third eye-measure moderator, captures how expected a
word is given its preceding context (Staub, 2011, 2015). Typically, when the next word aligns
with the reader’s predictions (e.g., peanut butterand____ — jelly), prior context naturally
pre-activates lexical and phonological features for the word (Kutas & Federmeier, 2011). For
highly predictable words, this means reductions in FFD and TRT and raised skipping rates, as
words require less evidence to be correctly identified (Rayner & Well, 1996; Schotter,
Angele, & Rayner, 2012; White et al., 2005). By contrast, when a word is unexpected, more
foveal time is needed and misanalysis/integration difficulties can cascade to produce longer
TRT when the word’s context needs to be revisited (Clifton, Staub, & Rayner, 2007; Warren,
McConnell, & Rayner, 2008).

Thus, length primarily reduces skipping and lengthens both early (FFD) and late
(TRT) measures via parafoveal constraints; frequency facilitates early lexical access (shorter
FFD, more skipping) through increasing entrenched lexical representations; and predictability
supports both early and late processing (shorter FFD/TRT, more skipping) by pre-activating
likely word candidates. Together, these properties jointly determine whether a word is fixated
at all and, if so, how much time is spent on initial identification versus later
integration/reanalysis.

Dyslexic slowdowns are likely amplified at each processing stage targeted by word
length, frequency, and predictability. First, according to the phonological-decoding account,
dyslexia is characterized by inefficient mappings from written text to sounds (Ziegler &
Goswami, 2005; Peterson & Pennington, 2015), with specific outcomes being slower, less
reliable access to phonological codes and corresponding lexical entries amongst dyslexics.
This bottleneck likely delays the “familiarity check” that triggers swift saccades to upcoming
words, and forces more foveal evidence to be accrued before the familiarity threshold is

reached (Reichle, Rayner, & Pollatsek, 2003), producing reading costs at FFD and TRT. The

reading cost this incurs also scales as phonological assembly or lexical activation becomes
more demanding, such as in long and rare words: long words require more text — sound
conversions while low-frequency words have naturally weaker, slower-to-activate lexical and
phonological representations for each word. Accordingly, the phonological-decoding account
broadly predicts disproportionately long slowdowns while reading (longer FFD) and more,
serial, fixations across words (longer TRT) for dyslexics to increase confidence of word
identification (Perfetti, 2007). Uncertainty at identification can also spill over into additional
TRT costs when initial misinterpretation must be resolved later in the text (Clifton, Staub, &
Rayner, 2007). In line with this, dyslexic readers exhibit more and longer fixations as length
and frequency increase, with fewer skips, more serial fixations, and longer gaze durations
relative to controls (Hy6na & Olson, 1995; Hutzler & Wimmer, 2004; De Luca et al., 2002).
Separately, well-documented working-memory limitations in dyslexia—spanning
phonological storage and central-executive control (Maehler & Schuchardt, 2016; Du &
Zhang, 2023; Smith-Spark & Fisk, 2007)—may selectively affect the use of context for
prediction and thus magnify costs when contextual predictability is low. Even in typical
readers, lower predictability reduces skipping and lengthens FFD and TRT (Rayner & Well,
1996; Staub, 2015). Thus, if dyslexic readers retain less context or update predictions less
effectively, they should show disproportionately longer fixations and TRT for unexpected
words, beyond typical readers. Converging evidence is consistent with this view: adults with
dyslexia show attenuated linguistic prediction effects (Engelhardt et al., 2021), and speed-
impaired readers (a group encompassing many dyslexics) generate forward inferences to a
reduced extent during sentence reading (Hawelka et al., 2015) — both signs of difficulties in
next-word prediction. Even so, dyslexia-specific tests of predictability in naturalistic reading

are rare, leaving this effect, so far, unquantified.

Taken together, both mechanisms—slowed phonological coding and constrained WM
for context—map naturally onto the three word-level features mentioned earlier: length and
frequency primarily tax early identification (skipping/FFD/TRT), whereas predictability
additionally stresses context maintenance and reanalysis (FFD/TRT), predicting larger time
costs for dyslexic readers.

However, despite strong individual literatures on length, frequency, and predictability
in typical readers, current evidence falls short of a transparent, word-aligned account of
dyslexia, or a dyslexia—control time gap. Additionally, although modelling at the word level
is now standard, few studies adopt time-decomposition approaches that report interpretable
millisecond shifts and quantify how much of the group gap is explained by each studied
factor. This methodological gap matters for theory. Most mainstream models of reading (e.g.,
E-Z Reader and SWIFT) make quantitative predictions about how word-level differences
determine eye measure effects and total reading time (Reichle et al., 2003; Engbert et al.,
2005; Reichle et al., 2009). Thus, without a word-aligned variance partition we cannot
evaluate the relative importance textual features play, and consequently, are unable to
contrast empirical findings against these models. This also carries importance for potential
applications. Analyses that pair millisecond effect sizes with cross-validated prediction
models allow for transparent communication of how much each modifiable factor contributes
to a reader’s total reading time and enables extension of findings to different languages and
contexts with little additional effort for the experimenter, which can support the creation of
new screening thresholds, targeted interventions, and research tied to the direct modification
of these lexical properties.

The present study addresses these gaps by combining naturalistic eye-tracking during
connected-text reading with token-level alignment of word features and eye measures. We

first estimate interpretable millisecond shifts associated with word length, lexical frequency,

and predictability. Second, we evaluate the relative sensitivity of controls vs. dyslexics to
changes in these features. Finally, we quantify how much of the dyslexia—control reading
time gap these features jointly explain. Throughout the study, we break down our measure
into three key components: skipping rate, total reading time on a word (TRT), and a novel
expected reading time (ERT) measure, used to join skipping rate and TRT per word to

quantify the total contribution a feature has on reading times. We define ERT as:

ERT = (1 — P(skip)) x TRTpxatea

To offer clear, quantifiable effect sizes, we also employ a Q1—Q3 ms-shift approach. This
means we change our features from their 25th percentile (1st quartile) to the 75th percentile
(3rd quartile) to measure millisecond changes in our key measures (skipping, TRT, ERT).
With that considered, we outline three main, and one exploratory, hypotheses:

1. Feature effects: A Q1—Q3 shift in each of our three word-level features will significantly
change expected reading times (ERT) in the following direction:

o Word Length t > ERT ¢.
o Word Frequency t > ERT |.
o Word Predictability t (-surprisal) > ERT |.

2. Dyslexic amplification: Dyslexic readers will show amplified (directionally consistent)
ERT costs for each of these features.

3. Group decomposition: Q1—Q3 adjustments will significantly reduce the residual gap in
ERT between dyslexics and controls (improving reading times of both, but dyslexics
more).

4. Exploratory decomposition: Dyslexics will show attenuated skipping rate effects across

all three features while showing amplified TRT effects.

Method
Participants
Data from fifty-seven adults was drawn from the open-access CopCo dataset (38 controls, 19
dyslexic) (Hollenstein et al., 2022). The overall mean age was 31.88 years (SD = 10.98; range
= 20-64). By group, controls averaged 29.79 years (SD = 7.92; n = 38) and dyslexic readers
averaged 36.05 years (SD = 14.77; n = 19). The sample included 40 women and 17 men
(controls: 28 F/10 M; dyslexic: 12 F/7 M). Most participants reported Danish as their native
language (overall n = 44; controls n = 25; all dyslexic participants reported Danish).
Reading/comprehension screening measures indicated mean comprehension accuracy of .80
(SD = .14) overall, with group means of .81 (controls) and .79 (dyslexic). Words-per-minute
averaged 210.77 (SD = 74.18) overall, with 240.30 (SD = 60.74) for controls and 151.72 (SD
= 63.36) for dyslexic readers.
Materials and Task
Participants read multiple speeches/passages, with controls reading a mean of 4.94 speeches
(SD = 1.94) and dyslexics 2.89 speeches (SD = 1.05), yielding word-by-word eye-movement
data with identifiers for trial, paragraph, sentence, word position, and standard fixation-time
measures (e.g., total reading time, gaze duration) plus skipping flags. In total, all participants
read an average of 5799 words (SD=2505) with controls reading a mean of 6567 words (SD =
2500) while dyslexics read a mean of 4264 words (SD=1715) during data collection.
Measures and Outcome Definitions
We analysed (a) skipping probability, (b) fixation duration when a word was fixated (total
reading time; TRT), and (c) expected reading time (ERT). At the token level, ERT was
defined as 0 ms for skipped words and equal to TRT for fixated words; model-based ERT
predictions were joined from separate skip and duration models using our ERT equation:

ERT = (1 — P(skip)) X TRTpxateq. This decomposition allowed pathway-specific inference

for skipping vs. duration as well as a prediction of the overall effect of a feature on reading
times via ERT.
Data Preprocessing

Data Formatting. Feature columns were standardized to length (in characters),
frequency (in Zipf), surprisal (in bits), TRT (ms), and skip (0 or 1, with 1 = skipped).
Extreme fixation-duration outliers (> 3 SD above the fixated mean) were removed. Pooled
quartiles (Q1/Q3) were computed once for length, Zipf frequency, and surprisal, and
“orientation checks” verified that Q1—Q3 corresponded to shorter — longer, rarer — more
frequent, and more predictable — more surprising outputs, respectively. To address the
strong length—frequency correlation (7 = —.80) without residualization, we created seven
equal-frequency pooled length bins once on the combined sample and re-used these bins and
their pooled weights in all Zipf-conditional analyses of frequency.

Lexical frequency (Zipf) Computation. We aggregated multiple 1-million-token
Danish subcorpora from the Leipzig Corpora Collection (news, web, news crawl, Wikipedia,
mixed sources). For each archive, lists were lower-cased and duplicate frequencies merged;
tokens with count < 2 and punctuation-only strings were removed; up to the top 1.5-million-
word types were retained which yielded 98.6% coverage with our dataset. Missing word
frequencies (1.4%) were removed during analysis.

Contextual Predictability (Surprisal) Computation. We estimated word-level
surprisal using a causal Danish GPT-2 model (KennethTM/gpt2-medium-danish) scored
strictly left-to-right, to mimic reading. Per-token negative log-likelihoods were aligned to
words and summed; outputted nats were converted to bits (+ In 2).

Statistical Modelling
We fit group-specific generalized additive models (GAMs) with additive smooths with no

interaction terms included. The skip model was a binomial Logistic GAM predicting

probability of skipping —P(skip)—with smooth terms for length, Zipf (monotonic increasing
constraint), and surprisal. The duration model was a Linear GAM on log-TRT with smooths
for length, Zipf (monotonic decreasing constraint), and surprisal; predictions were back-
transformed to milliseconds using a smearing correction. Hyperparameters (number of
splines, 2) were selected separately by group using a two-stage, subject-wise procedure: (1)
pre-selection on a subject subsample via GroupKFold with grid-searched 4, applying the 1-
SE rule to choose the simplest model within one SE of the best; (2) validation with 10-fold
GroupKFold using the frozen hyperparameters (reporting AUC for skip and RMSE for
duration). Final models were refit on all data with those frozen settings. We retained access to
the skip and duration components for exploratory, pathway-specific analyses.
Hypotheses and Inference

Hypothesis 1 — Feature Effects. For each feature, we defined the effect as the average
marginal increase in ERT (in ms) between Q1 and Q3. For length and surprisal, we set only
that feature to Q1 vs. Q3 while holding the other predictors at their group means. For
frequency (Zipf), we evaluated effects conditionally within pooled length bins: within each
bin, we set Zipf to that bin’s Q1 vs. Q3, averaged per subject within bin, and then took the
weighted average across bins using the pooled bin weights. We computed pathway-specific
QI — Q3 shifts for skip, duration, and ERT.

Hypothesis 2 — Dyslexic Amplification. Amplification was defined as a slope ratio

(SR) for the Q3—Q1 contrast, computed per pathway (skip, duration, ERT):

SR=
lActril

Zipf SRs were computed within each pooled length bin and then averaged, by bin weight, to
produce the final SR. Word length and surprisal were each computed across the entire group

sample.

Hypothesis 3 — Gap Decomposition. We defined a single canonical gap (G_0) as the
subject-balanced mean difference in model-predicted ERT (dyslexic — control). The equal-
ease counterfactual clamped text difficulty for both groups by setting length and surprisal to
pooled Q1 (downward clamp) and Zipf to Q3 conditionally within pooled length bins. We
then recomputed the between-group gap; the reduction from (G_0) quantified how much of
the gap was explained by these text features. Feature-wise contributions to the ERT gap
reduction were averaged across the 8 model configurations (2*) obtained by toggling the three
two-way interactions—lengthx frequency, lengthxpredictability, and
frequencyxpredictability—on/off (the three-way interaction was excluded). For our
exploratory analysis, skipping vs. duration contributions were attributed via a two-order
Shapley decomposition: we computed marginal contributions with skip added before duration
and with duration added before skip, then averaged the two orders.

Resampling and Decision Rules. All inferential uncertainty used subject-level
bootstrapping (resampling subjects with replacement) with n = 3,000 resamples. We report
95% percentile confidence intervals and two-tailed p values using the conservative
((r+1)/(B+1)) correction; for hypothesis 2 we tested SRs against 1.0 (1.0 = no difference in
slope between dyslexics and controls). Pathway-specific effects (skip, duration, ERT) are
reported where relevant.

Software. All analyses were implemented in Python using pyGAM for GAM fitting
with GroupKFold cross-validation and custom utilities for caching, smearing correction, and
subject-level bootstrapping; steps and resources for reproducing our analysis are provided in

the open repository’s README script.

Results
Preliminary Analyses
The analytic sample comprised 57 participants (19 dyslexic, 38 control) contributing
322,776-word tokens with complete identifiers, after all outliers and missing values were
excluded. Overall skipping rate was ~0.38 (controls ~ .40; dyslexic ~ .28). Fixated-word total
reading time (TRT) averaged 335 ms in controls and 486 ms in dyslexic readers, consistent
with slower reading rates and lower skipping rates found in dyslexia. These descriptive
patterns are reported here to contextualize the model-based results reported below.
Model Outputs
Figure 1 shows fitted GAM smooths for controls (solid) and dyslexic readers (dashed) with
95% CIs; curves are trimmed to the Ist—99th percentiles. Figure 1 Panels A-C show
predicted skipping probability P(skip); Panels D-F show total reading time when fixated
(TRT); Panels G—I show expected reading time outcomes (ERT). Vertical dashed lines for
each smooth mark the 25th and 75th percentiles of our predictor (used in Q1 — Q3 shifts).
Model diagnostics are in Appendix Tables 1—2 and show our model performance to be
comparable with previous literature. Our duration GAMs (controls R* = .089; dyslexic R? =
.066) are comparable in magnitude to classic participant-level regressions that used the same
three predictors (Klieg] et al., 2004; median R? ~ .07).

Figure 2 shows the millisecond Q1—>Q3 change in ERT for each feature and group. Length
increased ERT in both groups, with a larger shift for dyslexic readers (controls: 98.99 ms,
95% CI [98.88, 99.11]; dyslexic: 108.87 ms, 95% CI [108.67, 109.09]; both p < .001). Zipf
frequency (evaluated conditionally within length bins) reduced ERT in both groups, again
with a larger reduction in dyslexia (controls: —17.22 ms, 95% CI [—17.50, —16.92]; dyslexic:
—25.66 ms, 95% CI [—26.83, —24.53]). Surprisal increased ERT in both groups, with a
substantially larger effect for dyslexic readers (controls: 10.65 ms, 95% CI [10.61, 10.69];

dyslexic: 24.98 ms, 95% CI [24.85, 25.12]; all p< .001).

Hypothesis 2: Dyslexic Amplification

Figure 3 summarizes slope ratios (SRs) for ERT and by pathway. Length showed modest
overall amplification on ERT (SR = 1.08, 95% CI [1.083, 1.083], p < .001), driven by
amplification in the duration pathway (SR = 1.16, 95% CI [1.155, 1.156], p < .001) and
attenuation in skipping (SR = 0.75, 95% CI [0.755, 0.755], p < .001). Zipf showed clear
overall amplification on ERT (SR = 1.34, 95% CI [1.29, 1.39], p < .001), with attenuation in
skipping (SR = 0.80, 95% CI [0.79, 0.83], p < .001) and modest amplification in duration (SR
= 1.08, 95% CI [1.00, 1.16], p = .047). Surprisal yielded the strongest amplification: ERT SR
= 2.32 (95% CI [2.316, 2.326], p < .001), with SR = 2.50 for duration (95% CI [2.480, 2.519],
p <.001) and a small amplification in skipping (SR = 1.04, 95% CI [1.03, 1.06], p < .001).

Hypothesis 3: Decomposition of the Dyslexic—Control Gap

Figure 4 reports three decomposition analyses. The between-group ERT gap was 97.28
ms/word (95% CI [94.25, 100.51], p < .001). Shapley decomposition attributed 63.21
ms/word (95% CI [62.53, 63.89]) to the duration pathway and 34.07 ms/word (95% CI
[33.89, 34.26]) to reduced skipping—approximately 65% and 35% of the gap, respectively,
shown in Figure 4B. Under an equal-ease counterfactual—clamping length and surprisal to
easier (Q1) values and Zipf to higher, bin-wise Q3 values in both groups—the gap shrank by
30.66 ms/word (95% CI [27.73, 33.69]), leaving a counterfactual gap of 66.61 ms/word (95%
CI [66.32, 66.85]; both p < .001), shown in Figure 4A. Feature-wise contributions to this
reduction were: surprisal, 13.67 ms/word (95% CI [12.88, 14.46]); length, 9.98 ms/word
(95% CI [6.49, 13.37]); and Zipf, 7.01 ms/word (95% CI [6.15, 7.90]). Taken together,
simplifying lexical difficulty (shorter, more frequent, more predictable words) eliminated

approximately 32% of the observed gap, shown in Figure 4C.

Discussion

Across naturalistic connected-text reading, three word-level features—length, lexical
frequency (Zipf), and predictability (surprisal)—showed strong, directionally predicted
effects on expected reading time (ERT). Dyslexic readers exhibited larger ERT sensitivities
than controls for all three features (length SR~1.08; Zipf SR~1.34; surprisal SR~2.32; all ps
<.001), directly supporting H1 and H2 and showing that findings already seen in typical
readers (Kliegl et al., 2004; Rayner et al., 2011) extend to dyslexics. In single-feature
contrasts, word length shifts reduced the dyslexic—control gap by ~9.98 ms/word, frequency
reduced it by ~7.01 ms/word, and surprisal by ~13.67 ms/word (all ps < .001). When all three
features were changed together (from the 25th — 75th percentile), the dyslexic—control gap
cumulatively decreased from ~97.28 ms/word to ~66.61 ms/word (a reduction of 30.66 ms or
~32% of the total dyslexic gap; p<.001). These consistent reductions support H3, showing
that the three word-level features we tested each produced large, disproportionate gap

reductions for dyslexic readers versus controls.

Beyond replication and extension of existing evidence, surprisal emerged as the
strongest (new) dyslexia-relevant feature: it showed, by far, the largest ERT amplification
(SR=2.32) and the largest single-feature gap reduction (13.67ms), indicating a uniquely high
sensitivity among dyslexic readers to contextual predictability. From the lens of the dyslexia
theories we presented, the surprisal effect strongly affirms the constrained working memory
account of dyslexia (Maehler & Schuchardt, 2016; Du & Zhang, 2023; Smith-Spark & Fisk,
2007), which predict that words burdening linguistic working memory should
disproportionately affect reading in dyslexics (Engelhardt et al., 2021; Hawelka et al., 2015).
Since word surprisal is just one of a multitude features affecting working memory at the word
level, these findings encourage further exploration into how much of the remaining dyslexic
reading gap these features may collectively explain (discussed in future directions).
Additionally, in line with the phonological account of dyslexia (Ziegler & Goswami, 2005;
Hy6naé & Olson, 1995), longer and rarer words were also anticipated to disproportionately
affect reading times by slowing lexical access and phonemic conversion. Although these
effects were smaller in magnitude, there were clear ERT amplifications in both length and
frequency, supporting the phonological account as well. Taken as a whole, our findings
demonstrate that working memory differences had a stronger reading-time influence on
dyslexics although phonological effects also had a fairly strong, smaller influence.

Our exploratory, pathway decomposition localized two thirds of the total dyslexic gap
to the fixation duration pathway (63.20 ms), with skipping accounting for a smaller, one-third
of the gap (34.07 ms). Additionally, our skip-pathway slope ratios showed strong
attenuations for length (~0.75) and Zipf (~0.80) in dyslexics, and very small amplifications
for surprisal (~1.04). These patterns fit with existing findings which consistently show
reductions in skipping amongst dyslexics (Hutzler & Wimmer, 2004; Hawelka et al., 2010)

and suggest that our features overwhelmingly improved reading times through reductions in

fixation times, not skipping, supporting our exploratory hypothesis. This also implies
manipulations in word length, frequency, and surprisal are mostly ineffective at increasing
rates of skipping for dyslexics; thus, other factors should be considered to fill this gap
(explored in future directions).

We addressed several possible confounds over the course of this study. First, we
observed a strong length—frequency collinearity (r = —.80) which we accounted for by
evaluating frequency conditionally within weighted length bins to estimate ms-shifts. Since
length and surprisal showed substantially weaker collinearities, we took the standard
approach of varying the target feature while holding other features at group means for our
ms-shift estimates. Our predictive modelling strategy included all three predictors
simultaneously as additive smooths, to mitigate confounding. However, interactions (e.g.,
lengthxsurprisal; lengthfrequency) were not explicitly included in our final model. We
initially considered interactions but found these showed no improvements on held-out
performance, distorting smooths, while significantly increasing the complexity of our model;
additionally, prior research found very little or no interactions between either length,
predictability, or frequency (Rayner et al., 2004, 2011; Kliegl et al., 2004), suggesting little
benefit to this approach. Therefore, to improve the generalizability and reduce likely
overfitting we decided to simplify our modelling approach to just include three main effects:
length, frequency, and surprisal. This was successful and maintained performance on each of
the key metrics cited. Finally, we used conservative percentile contrasts (25th<>75th
percentile shifts) to limit extrapolation, ensuring results were likely to generalize across texts,
languages, and experimental conditions, while avoiding extreme estimates. This likewise
resulted in clear, usable numbers.

Despite these considerations, an intrinsic limitation to our study was the purely

observational data which our model and gap-reduction statistics depended on. This means our

modelling choices (e.g. how we constrained our model and which predictors we omitted)
could have biased the millisecond contrasts we presented. Further studies could account for
this possibility by extending our model to a new dataset (new language, texts, and features)
or—even more usefully—implementing an equivalent, randomized manipulation within a
naturalistic reading scenario to compare outcomes with our model’s ERT predictions.
Attempting a preliminary evaluation against the literature, when we compared our modelled
control outputs against the closest equivalent study—the findings of Kliegl and colleagues
(2004)—-we found effect sizes and directions to be mutually consistent with our model. The
order of magnitudes and direction of values (see our figure 2) was the same—length (largest)
— frequency — predictability (smallest)—despite the study being conducted in German and
on a much smaller word corpus (1.1K vs 245.1K words). Our ERT slope curves likewise
showed qualitatively similar shapes and landmarks to the duration and skipping functions
reported by Kliegl and colleagues (2004): with a monotonic rise with length, approximately
log-linear frequency effects, and a comparatively smaller predictability influence on
durations (see figure 1.A-F). This offers preliminary support for our modelling choices.
When compared against the literature, our models also showed more conservative estimates
than other studies (e.g. Rayner et al., 2011; Kliegl et al., 2004); this potential underestimation
is expected, and most likely reflects the purposefully naturalistic (vs. highly controlled)
setting of our study, as well as the choice to employ a smaller (25—75th percentile) shift for
estimating main effects. Unfortunately, we could find no large-scale dyslexia studies which
used a similar methodology to ours, so we could not make an equivalent comparison for our
dyslexic outputs.

Considering future directions, despite clear positive effects, a sizeable residual gap
remains (~66.61 ms/word; ~68% of the original gap). This means our three word-level

features—length, frequency, surprisal—are important but not sufficient to close the reading

gap, leaving space for additional features to be considered. Based on our findings, we suggest
two novel opportunities to explain additional portions of the dyslexic gap:

First, because surprisal showed the strongest dyslexic amplification (consistent with
working memory constraint theories, which imply weakened word prediction), it may be
beneficial to examine additional working-memory-relevant word features for dyslexics. In
this area, syntactic complexity appears the most promising to examine. Research consistently
shows that syntactic complexity loads on linguistic working memory in typical readers
(Gibson, 1998), and large eye-tracking corpora show that its measurement can predict word-
by-word reading times (Boston et al., 2008; Demberg & Keller, 2008). While there are many
methods for measuring linguistic complexity, the strongest per-word candidates are: (1) DLT
storage cost—the number of open dependencies maintained at each word (Gibson, 1998,
2000); (2) DLT integration cost—the distance-based cost incurred when a dependency closes
at a word (Gibson, 2000; Grodner & Gibson, 2005); and (3) parser stack/embedding depth
(e.g., Yngve or left-corner stack depth) as a direct working-memory load proxy at each word
(Yngve, 1960; Resnik, 1992). An exploration of either (or all) of these within our models,
could reasonably build on our findings that linguistic working memory can explain a large
portion of the observed dyslexic time gap.

Second, our exploratory decomposition showed that skipping accounts for roughly
one-third of the total reading gap, despite being largely unchanged by our three, word-level
manipulations (skip-path SRs: length ~0.75; Zipf ~0.80; surprisal ~1.04). This leaves ample
room for dyslexia-specific factors, which target the skipping pathway, to fill this gap. One
strong candidate in this area is the (spatially driven) parafoveal preview benefit—the
likelihood of extracting information from upcoming letters and words before fixation.
Dyslexic readers consistently show reduced preview benefits in eye-tracking tasks (Silva et

al., 2016; Yan et al., 2013), and these reductions chiefly decrease skip probability (Angele et

al., 2014; Gordon et al., 2013; Choi & Gordon, 2014), making it particularly relevant. Thus,
if preview benefit were modelled alongside our other features, it could directly target the
skipping pathway (which our study has mostly failed to change in dyslexics).

In sum, length, frequency, and surprisal levels change reading times in both groups,
but dyslexic readers are more sensitive to all three, especially surprisal. Simplifying these
features reduces the dyslexic—control time gap by ~one-third, with the remaining gap residing
in the fixation duration pathway. Our clear, significant results provide actionable, word-level
factors for designing new interventions while motivating next steps to examine additional
predictors and experimental validations to improve beyond our current model. Together, we
offer the first answer to why dyslexic reading takes longer—and when, supporting new

reading models and interventions built with our findings.
