Abstract

The history of the Korean language is characterized by a discrepancy between its spoken and written forms and
a pivotal shift from Chinese characters to the Hangul alphabet. However, this linguistic evolution has remained
largely unexplored in NLP due to a lack of accessible historical corpora. To address this gap, we introduce the
Open Korean Historical Corpus, a large-scale, openly licensed dataset spanning 1,300 years and 6 languages,
as well as under-represented writing systems like Korean-style Sinitic (Idu) and Hanja-Hangul mixed script. This
corpus contains 18 million documents and 5 billion tokens from 19 sources, ranging from the 7th century to 2025.
We leverage this resource to quantitatively analyze major linguistic shifts: (1) Idu usage peaked in the 1860s
before declining sharply; (2) the transition from Hanja to Hangul was a rapid transformation starting around 1890;
and (3) North Korea’s lexical divergence causes modern tokenizers to produce up to 51 times higher out-of-
vocabulary rates. This work provides a foundational resource for quantitative diachronic analysis by capturing the
history of the Korean language. Moreover, it can serve as a pre-training corpus for large language models, poten-
tially improving their understanding of Sino-Korean vocabulary in modern Hangul as well as archaic writing systems.

1. Introduction

Written communication on the Korean peninsula
before the 20th century is linguistically compelling      Classical
due to the inherent discrepancy between its spo-     wie
ken language and writing systems. Prior to the cre-

ation of the native alphabet, Hangul (¢t=), Kore-

ans borrowed Hanja (354) and used Classical Chi-        korean
nese as the primary literary language. Because      e301
the grammatical structure of Korean (SOV) differs
from that of Classical Chinese (SVO), unique tran-
scription systems like Idu were developed to bet-
ter reflect native grammar (Handel, 2019). Even
after the invention of Hangul in the 15th century,
a centuries-long transition involving mixed script
usage preceded the predominantly Hangul-based
writing of today. The very success of this transi-
tion, however, has rendered centuries of Hanja-
based records illegible to most contemporary Kore-
ans, making its accessibility a significant challenge
for modern NLP.

However, computational research on Korean
has predominantly focused on modern, Hangul-
based texts, largely neglecting the intermediate pe-
riod of Hanja-Hangul mixed script. A significant
barrier to this research is the lack of accessible
historical corpora. Most corpora created by the

the 7th century through 2025. As illustrated in Fig-
ure 1, the collection encompasses six languages:
Korean (Middle, Early Modern, Modern, North),
Classical Chinese, and Modern Japanese. This is,
to our knowledge, the first openly licensed corpus
to offer broad temporal coverage of these historical
stages, particularly Middle Korean and Early Moa-
ern Korean, as well as under-represented writing
systems, including Korean-style Sinitic (Idu) and
Hanja-Hangul mixed script. Table 1 provides se-
lected examples that illustrate this linguistic diver-
sity across different eras.

Using this corpus, we quantitatively analyze ma-
jor linguistic shifts. Our analysis of Korean-style
Sinitic (Idu) shows its usage peaked in the 1860s
before declining sharply, particularly after the 1894
Kabo Reform. We also trace the diachronic transi-
tion from Hanja to Hangul, finding it was a rapid
transformation rather than a gradual shift; writing
exclusively in Classical Chinese dominated written
records until 1890, but by 1980, Hangul comprised
over 93% of characters. Furthermore, we quan-
tify the lexical divergence of North Korean, which
causes modern tokenizers to produce up to 51
times higher out-of-vocabulary (OOV) rates due
to its unique orthography for loanwords and dis-
tinct native vocabulary. We release the corpus and
our processing code under the CC BY-NC 4.0 and
MIT licenses, respectively, to facilitate further re-
search in Korean diachronic linguistics and histori-
cal NLP.'

2. Background

In this section, we examine the historical back-
ground of the Korean language and writing system
and discuss how they have changed over time.

2.1. Historical Development of Korean

The Korean language, with its earliest extant
records dating back to the early 5th century (Kim,
1998; Bailblé, 2016), has undergone substantial
changes. While multiple periodization schemes
have been proposed, reflecting different schol-
arly foci and periodization criteria, we adopt the
four-period scheme (NIKL, 2010) for consistency
and clarity. This provides a useful overview by
combining dynastic transitions and major linguistic
changes as criteria for division.

Ancient (-10C) This period spans from before
the Common Era to the establishment of the
Goryeo dynasty in 918. During this period, Chi-
nese characters were introduced to the Korean
peninsula and became the primary medium of writ-
ten Korean, known as Hanja (Choo, 2016). Only
a few written records from this era have survived.

Medieval (10C-16C) The creation of Hangul,
the native Korean alphabet, in 1443 marked a
turning point in the history of the Korean lan-
guage (Pae, 2018). Hangul aimed to mitigate
the disparity between native spoken Korean and
written Korean borrowed from Chinese characters.


===== PAGE BREAK =====

Yet its impact was gradual, as written Korean con-
tinued to rely heavily on Hanja. At the same time,
the language differed from its modern form, most
notably through a tonal system.

Early Modern (17C-late 19C) The Korean lan-
guage underwent significant changes around the
17th century. In particular, it experienced a grad-
ual loss of its tonal system, including the tonal mark
(pangjeom, 24, “side marks”) and the vowel
(arae-a, « ). In addition, the overall grammar struc-
ture became simpler than in earlier periods. Fur-
thermore, the devastation following the Imjin War
(1592-1598) led to the loss of older texts and the
weakening of the orthographic conventions that
had been maintained in previous eras.

Modern (late 19C—present) During this period,
Korean underwent dynamic changes shaped by
major historical events. In the late 19th century,
Hangul was granted official status as the national
script in the wake of the modernization move-
ment. However, Japanese colonial rule (1910—
1945) restricted the use of Korean language and
taught Japanese ideology and language (Pak and
Hwang, 2011). Afterwards, it gradually diverged
into distinct varieties in the north and the south, fol-
lowing the division of the peninsula (1945).

2.2. Diverse Writing Systems in Korean

Korean has undergone complex, multi-layered
changes in its writing systems.

Korean-style Sinitic After the presumed intro-
duction of Chinese characters around the 2nd cen-
tury BCE (Eom, 2002), the disparity between spo-
ken Korean and written Chinese motivated the
Korean-style Sinitic systems, such as /du (writ-
ing Chinese characters in Korean word order)
(King, 2022), Gugyeol (adding grammatical mark-
ers to Classical Chinese texts) (Kim, 2004), and
Hyangchal (used mainly for transcribing vernacu-
lar poetry, hyangga) (Lee and Ramsey, 2011).

Sino-Korean Mixed Script This system refers
to the combined use of Hanja and Hangul, and
reflects the coexistence of the two writing sys-
tems following the invention of Hangul in the
15th century (Pae, 2018). This system became
widespread in the late 19th century and continued
into the modern era (Joyce and Crellin, 2019).

Orthographic Divergence after Korean Divi-
sion While both North and South Korea estab-
lished their orthographic systems based on the
Unified Korean Orthography (1933), they have di-
verged through separate revision processes after
the division (Lee, 2021). Moreover, in South Ko-
rea, standardization was primarily based on the
Seoul dialect, whereas in North Korea, it was cen-
tered on the Pyongyang variety (Song, 2015).

3. Open Korean Historical Corpus

This section details the construction of the Open
Korean Historical Corpus, outlining the method-
ology for data collection, text preprocessing, lan-
guage identification, and schema design. We pro-
vide a statistical overview of the corpus and a dis-
cussion of the legal considerations for its release.

3.1.

To build a comprehensive resource, we target
key languages and writing systems with historical
significance on the Korean peninsula. The lan-
guages include several varieties of Korean (Mid-
dle, Early Modern, Modern, and North Korean),
Classical Chinese, and Japanese. The inclu-
sion of Japanese addresses its enforced use dur-
ing the colonial period (1910-1945), which left
a substantial body of written records and influ-
enced the Korean language post-independence.
The corpus covers a range of writing systems, in-
cluding Korean-style Sinitic (Idu), Hanja-Hangul
mixed script, Old Hangul, modern Hangul, and the
Japanese writing system. Sources are selected
based on their ability to provide digitized original
texts accompanied by publication year metadata.
Data is gathered primarily by web scraping insti-
tutional websites using Python libraries such as
BeautifulSoup, HTTPX, and Selenium, and by di-
rect downloads where available. Data collection
occurred from May 2025 to October 2025, with the
most recent documents from North Korean news
sources dated June 19, 2025.

3.2. Text Preprocessing

Our preprocessing pipeline first applied univer-
sal normalization to all documents and then used
source-aware heuristics to remove archival and
digitization artifacts. The initial normalization
stage standardized Unicode text to its NFKC form
to resolve compatibility variants, collapsed irregu-
lar whitespace, and removed non-printable control
characters. The subsequent cleaning stage ap-
plied targeted rules to specific sources. These op-
erations included:

« Removing boilerplate text that indicates miss-
ing content or metadata.

« Removing modern in-line translations and iso-
lating original texts.

* Stripping erroneous metadata, like modern
Korean titles or image captions that were
merged into the main text field.

¢ Filtering out documents with a high ratio of
noise-to-text, which often resulted from encod-
ing errors.

3.3. Language and Script Identification

We perform an initial analysis using two methods:
a GlotLID (Kargaran et al., 2023) language identi-
fication model constrained to predict from a small
set of relevant languages (e.g., Korean, Japanese,
Chinese), and acharacter-level script analysis that
computes the proportion of Hangul, Hanja, and
Kana. The final classification is determined by

a set of rules that integrate these preliminary re-
sults with source-specific metadata. This heuris-
tic approach is necessary, as modern language
identification models are less reliable for histori-
cal texts. For instance, documents from sources
known to contain only Classical Chinese, such as
the Annals of the Joseon Dynasty, are categorized
as Classical Chinese based on their origin. For
Korean-language texts, we assign a historical pe-
riod—Middle, Early Modern, or Modern Korean—
based on the document's publication year.

3.4. Data Schema and Format

The corpus is distributed in the JSON Lines for-
mat, where each line is a self-contained JSON ob-
ject representing a single document. As shown
in Table 3, the schema is designed for flexibility
and traceability, allowing for the aggregation of
documents from diverse sources. Each entry in-
cludes fields for identification and attribution, man-
ually curated classification labels for targeted anal-
ysis, and distinct fields for both raw and normalized
text to ensure data integrity and usability for NLP
research. An example of a single data instance in
JSON format is shown in Figure 2.

3.5. Corpus Statistics and Distribution

The Open Korean Historical Corpus is a large-
scale collection of 17.7 million documents from
the 19 sources detailed in Table 2. It contains
6.3 billion characters, which corresponds to 5.1 bil-
lion tokens as measured by the o200k_base tok-
enizer'*, making it a substantial resource for the
historical study of the Korean language. The cor-
pus’s temporal distribution, visualized in Figure 3,
shows a heavy concentration in later periods. The

creases significantly following the establishment of
the Joseon dynasty in 1392 and shows a consis-
tent upward trend into the modern era.

apparent data sparsity before 1392 is partly due
to visualization constraints, as many individual his-
torical documents, particularly from non-periodical
sources like AKS, KLC, and NHMA, lack precise
year-level metadata and are therefore not plotted.
The data volume increases substantially with the
establishment of the Joseon Dynasty in 1392, a
period known for systematic record-keeping, and
then expands exponentially from the late 19th cen-
tury with the advent of mass media. This results in
a sampling bias where modern texts are far more
represented than those from earlier eras.

4. Discussion

4.1. Temporal Dynamics of Korean-Style
Sinitic
To quantitatively analyze the temporal distribution
of Korean-style Sinitic (Idu), we first compiled a
merged lexicon from two Idu dictionaries (DKU;
AKS). Using this lexicon, we identify Idu docu-
ments using a longest non-overlapping matching
method with the Aho—Corasick algorithm (Aho and
Corasick, 1975). Documents are scored by the fre-
quency of Idu markers, normalized by the Hanja
character count. A document is classified as Idu
if this score exceeds length-stratified thresholds
(1.04% for <100 chars; 0.86% for 101-300 chars;
0.38% for >301 chars); exclusion lists are em-

y-axis, logarithmic scale) represent the total count
of Idu instances per decade. The black line with cir-
cular markers (right y-axis, percentage) illustrates
the share of Idu within the analyzed documents
from the 1630s to the 1900s.

ployed to filter borderline cases and minimize false
positives. To mitigate proportional bias, our anal-
ysis is restricted to the 1637-1910 period, which
ensures comparable coverage across the four sub-
corpora (RDGO, DRS, AKS, KIKS) of administra-
tive and legal records; we also exclude sources
with an Idu share below 1%.

As shown in Figure 4, the data reveal a grad-
ual increase in Idu usage from 1637 to the 1860s,
consistent with higher survival rates for later-period
documents (Lee, 2004), followed by a steady de-
cline through 1910. The post-1860s decline indi-
cates factors beyond preservation artifacts. The
most significant drop occurs between the 1890s
and 1900s, strongly correlating with major lan-
guage policy changes: the Kabo Reform (1894),
which mandated Hangul in official documents, and
a 1908 directive favoring Hanja—Hangul script over
Idu. This temporal alignment suggests language
policy accelerated the decline of Idu in administra-
tive contexts. We interpret these figures as conser-
vative lower bounds, as the corpus includes only
digitized materials and our classification method
was optimized for high precision.

4.2. The Diachronic Shift from Hanja to
Hangul

To measure the diachronic shift of script usage
from Hanja to Hangul, we analyzed all documents
in our corpus written in the Korean language or
Classical Chinese from 1390 to 1999. Using regu-
lar expressions based on Unicode properties and
blocks, we counted Hanja and Hangul characters
in each document. These counts were then aggre-
gated into a timeframe of 10-year decades, and we
calculate both the character-level script proportion
and the ratio of documents written in the Hanja-
Hangul mixed script system, where the threshold
is over 10% of both Hanja and Hangul usage.

ated by four different encoder models when tok-
enizing the NK News and SK Web corpora. Type
indicates if the model is trained on multilingual (M)
or South Korean (kK) texts.

As shown in Figure 5, the data reveals a rapid
transformation rather than a gradual shift. From
the release of Hangul in the mid 15th century to the
late 19th century, Hanja usage was dominant, with
almost all documents written exclusively in Classi-
cal Chinese. A sharp decline in Hanja-exclusive
texts began around 1890, which can be interpreted
as a result of modernizing efforts such as the Kabo
Reform (1894), which mandated Hangul for of-
ficial documents. Meanwhile, as Hanja-Hangul
mixed script usage rose and then fell, the usage of
Hangul increased rapidly. By the 1980s, Hangul
became the primary script, accounting for over
93% of characters and reflecting language policies
that relegated Hanja to a supplementary role. This
result accurately reflects known turning points of
Korean language history, and shows that our cor-
pus is useful for such diachronic analysis.

4.3. A Preliminary Analysis of Tokenizer
Coverage on North Korean Text

Decades of political separation have caused the
Korean language to diverge lexically between the
North and South. As a preliminary step to under-

stand potential model limitations, we assess how
well the tokenizer, the initial stage of language
modeling, handles this divergence. We quan-
tify this gap by measuring the out-of-vocabulary
(OOV) rate—the proportion of unknown tokens
generated by the tokenizers of four pre-trained
encoder models'*"—when processing our North
Korean news corpus (KCNA) and a comparably-
sized South Korean web text baseline.'® All texts
were pre-processed using NFKC normalization
and filtered to retain only complete Hangul sylla-
bles.

Our results confirm a measurable lexical gap at
the token level. As shown in Table 5, OOV rates
for North Korean text were significantly higher for
most models, ranging from 3 to 51 times, though
the mBERT model showed a comparable rate.
However, the absolute rates remained low (un-
der 0.3%), suggesting modern subword tokeniz-
ers are surprisingly resilient in segmenting the text.
An analysis of the most frequent OOV tokens (Ta-
ble 4) reveals the divergence stems primarily from
North Korea’s unique orthography for loanwords
(e.g., &O|Z/Zt& for Germany) and distinct vocab-
ulary (e.g., & for anniversary). This lexical gap,
though small, can still disproportionately impact
sensitive tasks like named entity recognition, high-
lighting a clear opportunity for model improvement
through vocabulary expansion.

Model identifiers are google-bert/ bert-
base-multilingual-cased, FacebookAI/ xlm-
roberta-base, klue/bert-base, and beomi/
kcbert-—base.

'6The South Korean baseline was a 5% random sam-
ple of the HAERAE-HUB/ KOREAN-WEBTEXT corpus,
which is available on Hugging Face. Our KCNA cor-
pus contains approximately 170k documents and 126M
characters; the sampled SK corpus contains approxi-
mately 64k documents and 175M characters.

5. Related Work

Korean Corpora for Modern NLP Large-scale
multilingual corpora have incorporated Korean
data, but their coverage remains limited in both
temporal and linguistic diversity, failing to capture
earlier stages or varieties of the language that
are essential for studying linguistic change and
variation. Resources such as OSCAR (Suarez
et al., 2019), mC4 (Xue et al., 2021), and Cul-
turaX (Nguyen et al., 2024) include Korean data,
but these materials primarily reflect modern stan-
dardized usage. Dedicated Korean corpora, in-
cluding Al-Hub'” (NIA, 2020), koTenTen (Engine,
2018), Korpora (ko-nlp team, 2019), and the Open
Korean Corpora (Cho et al., 2020), have estab-
lished valuable resources for modern Korean NLP.
However, their scope likewise remains confined to
contemporary language. Moreover, access to Al-
Hub datasets is limited to domestic applicants, and
their overseas use—including by Korean nation-
als abroad—is either restricted or requires sepa-
rate agreements with the responsible institutions
and government bodies, limiting global research
use. Overall, existing Korean corpora lack tem-
poral depth and script variation, leaving historical
materials and mixed-script texts largely unrepre-
sented.

Historical Korean Corpora Historical corpora
play a crucial role in preserving cultural heritage
and enabling longitudinal analyses of language
and society. Historical corpora initiatives such as
Shamela (Belinkov et al., 2016), CHisIEC (Tang
et al., 2024), and CCOHA (Alatrash et al., 2020)
illustrate how historical datasets can mitigate tem-
poral bias and support research on long-term lin-
guistic and cultural change.

In the Korean context, the inclusion of classical
texts written in Hanja has long been regarded as
essential, since Hanja served as the principal writ-
ten medium prior to the invention and populariza-
tion of Hangul. Several efforts have been made
to build historical corpora, including the Integrated
Database of Korean Classics (ITKC) and KoHiCo
(NIKL, 2024). The lack of standardized formats
and limited script coverage, however, still pose
challenges for researchers and hinder reproducibil-
ity.

National projects further contribute by encom-
passing both classical and modern data, but their
main challenge lies in restricted accessibility and
licensing. The Sejong Corpus (1998-2007) con-
sists of about 200M tokens across written, spoken,
parallel (Korean—English/Japanese), and histori-
cal data (An et al., 2025). However, some obsta-
cles, such as its limited distribution (mainly in DVD

https ://www.aihub.or.kr

format), have hindered its usage. The Modu Cor-
pus (NIKL, 2019) provides diverse datasets (sen-
timent, NER, parallel texts, newspapers, everyday
dialogues) and serves as a de facto standard re-
source. However, access requires registration and
approval, and its diachronic coverage remains nar-
row.

To overcome limited accessibility, openness,
and script coverage of the existing historical cor-
pora, we introduce an openly available corpus
spanning a broad temporal and linguistic range
—including Hanja, Korean-style Sinitic (Idu), Mid-
dle and Early Modern Korean, and Japanese texts
from the colonial period—integrated into a unified,
NLP-ready format for large-scale exploration of Ko-
rean language and culture across time.

6. Conclusion

In this work, we introduced the Open Korean
Historical Corpus, a large-scale, openly licensed
dataset of 17.7 million documents designed to ad-
dress the critical lack of accessible historical data
for Korean NLP. By compiling and standardiz-
ing texts from the 7th century to the present, our
corpus provides the first comprehensive resource
for studying the language’s diachronic evolution
across diverse languages and writing systems,
including Classical Chinese, Korean-style Sinitic,
and Hanja-Hangul mixed script. We present a
quantitative analysis of notable linguistic changes,
including Korean-style Sinitic, the Hanja-to-Hangul
transition, and the lexical divergence of North Ko-
rean. We release this corpus and our processing
code not only to facilitate research into the rich his-
tory of the Korean language, but also to lay the
groundwork for models that can make these his-
torical documents more accessible to the general
public.

Ethics Statement

The Open Korean Historical Corpus is provided for
research in historical linguistics and natural lan-
guage processing. To ensure academic integrity,
we provide detailed source information for all texts
to properly attribute the work of the original cre-
ators and digitizing institutions.

We caution users to handle the data with care,
as it contains sensitive materials. We have in-
cluded North Korean texts from state media for lin-
guistic analysis only; this inclusion does not con-
stitute an endorsement of their ideological con-
tent. We also acknowledge that historical docu-
ments contain outdated biases that language mod-
els trained on this corpus may learn and repro-
duce.

Limitations

The primary limitation of this corpus is its inher-
ent sampling bias. It is constructed from extant
and digitized materials, which do not represent a
complete or balanced sample of all historical doc-
uments ever produced. This bias is evident in the
temporal distribution of the data, where modern pe-
riods are heavily overrepresented compared to ear-
lier eras from which fewer texts have survived or
been digitized. Furthermore, the scope of the cor-
pus is intentionally limited to written texts. It does
not include transcribed spoken language, making
it unsuitable for certain linguistic studies, such as
those focusing on phonological or conversational
phenomena.
