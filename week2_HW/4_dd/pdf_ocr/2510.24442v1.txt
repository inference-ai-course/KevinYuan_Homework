Abstract

Since real-world legal experiments are often costly or infeasible, simulating legal
societies with Artificial Intelligence (AI) systems provides an effective alternative
for verifying and developing legal theory, as well as supporting legal administration.
Large Language Models (LLMs), with their world knowledge and role-playing
capabilities, are strong candidates to serve as the foundation for legal society
simulation. However, the application of LLMs to simulate legal systems remains
underexplored. In this work, we introduce Law in Silico, an LLM-based agent
framework for simulating legal scenarios with individual decision-making and
institutional mechanisms of legislation, adjudication, and enforcement. Our exper-
iments, which compare simulated crime rates with real-world data, demonstrate
that LLM-based agents can largely reproduce macro-level crime trends and provide
insights that align with real-world observations. At the same time, micro-level
simulations reveal that a well-functioning, transparent, and adaptive legal system
offers better protection of the rights of vulnerable individuals.

1 Introduction

“We wish to acquire knowledge about a target entity T. But T is not easy to study directly. So we
proceed indirectly. Instead of T we study another entity M, the ‘model’ ...”

— Gilbert & Doran

The analysis of law has traditionally been carried out through analytic methods, which rely heavily
on theoretical frameworks and retrospective analyses [1]. While this method has proven valuable, it
restricts our ability to understand the dynamic and evolving nature of legal systems. Legal systems,
like any social system, are profoundly shaped by the interactions among individuals, institutions, and
the broader societal context. As a result, distributed AI systems present a promising alternative to
traditional legal analysis: by simulating legal systems, we can observe how laws affect individual
behavior and societal dynamics in ways that would be difficult to study directly in the real world.

Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) [9], which are trained on vast and diverse real-
world corpora, have demonstrated impressive capabilities in language modeling and generalization

and institutional dynamics.

across a wide range of downstream tasks. These models are capable of understanding the languages,
cultures, and societies of different countries [14], essentially providing a probabilistic model of
the world. LLM-based agents leverage the power of context, transforming the general world
distributions learned by these models into a specific, individual-focused profile distribution [2]. This
enables the models to exhibit strong role-playing capabilities, where decisions are based on the
agent’s background and situational context. By integrating these capabilities, LLM-based agent
systems [8] provide a powerful and scalable approach to simulating legal societies, offering a unique
way to model the complexities of legal decision-making and agent interactions.

While prior studies explore general social simulations or specific legal tasks like judicial
decision-making [5] (15, they do not examine how macro-level societal factors influence individual
choices, nor how agent interactions contribute to the emergent evolution of legal systems. Our
work bridges this gap by introducing Law in Silico, a simulation framework that comprises: (1)
Hierarchical Legal Agent Modeling: We employ hierarchical sampling from real-world statistical
distributions to approximate the multivariate characteristics relevant to legal decision-making and
societal behavior. (2) Scenario-Based Decision-Making: Our framework supports both large-scale,
single-shot decision-making simulations and interactive, multi-turn simulations in specific scenarios
(é.g., crime exposure or conflicts of interest). (3) Legal System: We enable the flexible initialization
and modification of laws, implementing evolving legislative mechanisms while considering factors
such as corruption in the judiciary to build a more realistic legal system. Through macro-level
simulations of illegal scenarios (theft, assault, and sex trade), we find that the crime rates simulated by
our system largely align with real-world macro crime rates, while also revealing consistent patterns
across various crime-related factors. In our micro-level experiments, we compared different legal
system configurations in scenarios involving labor exploitation and anti-exploitation. We surprisingly
reproduced the “cat-and-mouse” dynamics observed in the real world. Moreover, results from
controlled experiments demonstrate the importance of a well-functioning, transparent, and efficient
legal system in protecting the welfare of vulnerable populations.

Our main contributions can be summarized as follows:

¢ A Comprehensive Framework for Legal Simulation: We propose Law in Silico, a novel
simulation framework that combines hierarchical legal agent modeling based on real-world
statistical data, diverse scenario-based decision-making (both single-shot and interactive),
and dynamic legal system mechanisms, including realistic factors such as judicial corruption.

based agent system can realistically replicate macro-level crime trends, with simulated crime
rates closely aligning with real-world data and capturing key influencing variables.

crucial insights into the characteristics of effective legal systems and how agent interactions
can drive the evolution of legal frameworks, particularly in protecting vulnerable groups.

2 Related Work

LLM-Based Agents The emergence of large language models (LLMs) has revolutionized various
fields, demonstrating remarkable capabilities in natural language understanding, generation, and
complex reasoning [21]. Beyond traditional tasks, LLMs are increasingly leveraged to create
autonomous agents capable of simulating human-like behavior and interactions within diverse
environments. Early work in this area primarily focused on developing LLM-driven agents for
tasks such as planning, problem-solving, and conversational AI, with notable examples including
ReAct [22], BabyAGI, and Voyager [16], all of which integrate reasoning, action, and exploration for
autonomous decision-making. Subsequent research has explored architectural improvements and
prompting strategies to enhance agent autonomy and decision-making in open-ended environments.
For example, LLMob developed an LLM agent framework for personal mobility generation,
aligning LLMs with real-world activity patterns to simulate human-like mobility behaviors. Moreover,
the Desire-driven Autonomous Agent (D2A) autonomously selects tasks driven by multi-
dimensional desires, such as social interaction and self-fulfillment, enabling more adaptive and
human-like behavior. Despite the numerous explorations of agent-based models, there is still a gap in
research regarding the modeling of agents in the context of large-scale legal societies. Whether LLM-
based agents can accurately express individual profiles in criminal contexts—and make decisions
consistent with real-world macro and micro-level trends—remains an open question.

Legal Society Simulation Simulating legal societies can provide valuable insights into how laws
influence behavior and shape societal dynamics. These simulations allow researchers to test legal
frameworks, understand law enforcement mechanisms, and predict legal outcomes in scenarios that
are difficult or costly to explore in the real world [I]. Early works in legal simulations often relied on
rule-based knowledge systems to model and simulate legal processes. Although LLM-based
social simulations have been explored in works such as Smallville and AgentSociety [11],
large-scale legal society simulations are still rare. Most existing work focuses on societal behaviors
without incorporating complex legal systems at scale. Recent legal agent-based simulations using
LLMs include AgentsCourt [5], which simulates courtroom processes with judge and lawyer agents,
and Agents on the Bench [6], which models judicial decision-making with judge and juror agents
to improve fairness and accuracy. LawLuo simulates legal consultations with multi-agent
interactions mimicking law firm operations, while MASER generates data for legal training via
agent-based simulations. However, these works mostly focus on specific legal domains, with little
research on large-scale legal societies that integrate both macro and micro-level legal dynamics. Our
work bridges this gap by modeling agents in legal societies that simulate the macro-level impact of
law on individuals, while also supporting the complex, dynamic processes of legislation and law
enforcement at the micro-level.

3 Law in Silico

In this Section, we introduce Law in Silico, an LLM-based legal simulation framework. Our
framework places large language models (LLMs) at the core of agent, legislative and judicial decision-
making, aiming to simulate key dimensions of legal societies—including individual-level crime
propensity, rights-protection dynamics, and the operation of enforcement and legislative mechanisms.
We use real-world societal statistics to construct agent profiles, allowing the simulation to reflect
social heterogeneity relevant to crime and legal behavior. As illustrated in Figure[I] the framework
supports both macro-level statistical simulations—examining how aggregate indicators such as
income, education, and drugs influence crime rates—and micro-level simulations that model how
legal institutions affect decision-making and welfare in bilateral conflict scenarios. The framework
consists of three main components: Hierarchical Legal Agent Modeling, Scenario-Based Decision-
Making, and the Legal System.


===== PAGE BREAK =====

3.1 Hierarchical Legal Agent Modeling

Research in criminology and legal studies has identified a wide range of factors that influence an
individual’s propensity to commit a crime [[7]. To build realistic legal agents, we incorporate these
factors into the internal profiles of LLM-based agents, such that each agent carries a representation
of their socioeconomic background, social conditioning, and legal perceptions. These internalized
traits influence how agents perceive risk, make decisions, and finally interpret legal constraints in
downstream scenarios.

We model three primary categories of factors: (1) socioeconomic factors, such as poverty and in-
equality, unemployment, and disparities in educational attainment, which shape the agent’s perceived
opportunity structure and life incentives; (2) social environment, including religious affiliation,
societal background (e.g., community cohesion), and exposure to drugs or gang influence, which
inform the agent’s moral reasoning and behavioral norms; and (3) legal factors, such as perceived
punishment severity and law enforcement effectiveness, which are integrated into the agent’s mind as
a punishment impression—a subjective mental model of legal risk and deterrence.

In macro-level simulations, we ground these attributes using official statistical data, enabling us
to reflect population-level variations across different societal contexts. Rather than sampling each
factor independently, we adopt a hierarchical sampling strategy that accounts for correlations among
variables—for example, the relationship between income and education, gender and employment, or
age and likelihood of drug or gang involvement. This approach allows us to approximate realistic
population distributions and preserve structural dependencies observed in empirical data. In micro-
level simulations, agent profiles can be further enriched with individualized narratives, such as
occupational roles or personality traits, to support fine-grained decision modeling. These personalized
elements help simulate the diversity of motivations and constraints that real individuals bring into
legal interactions.

3.2 Scenario-Based Decision Making

Our framework supports two complementary modes of decision simulation: large-scale, single-shot
decision making for macro-level analysis, and multi-turn, interactive decision making among multiple
agents for micro-level simulations. In both settings, agent behavior is guided by a scenario context
that integrates the agent’s profile with the surrounding environment or situation. These scenarios
serve as the basis for generating realistic behavioral responses under legal or moral pressure.

In macro-level simulations, we design situational prompts that expose agents to potential crime-
inducing environments, accompanied by a predefined set of action options, typically including both
legal and illegal choices. Since it is infeasible to simulate an agent’s continuous experience in the real
world, we approximate crime tendencies by observing agent decisions in these representative high-
risk contexts. Agent profiles are combined with scenario descriptions to form descriptive decision
contexts, which are then processed in batch by an optimized LLM engine (e.g., vVLLM) to efficiently
generate decisions across thousands of agents. The resulting choice distributions are aggregated for
statistical analysis, such as estimating scenario-specific crime rates.

In micro-level simulations, agents engage in sequential, multi-agent interactions under a shared
and partially observed scenario. Each agent selects actions turn by turn, based on its own profile,
the evolving environment, and the behavior of other agents. To handle the open-ended nature of
LLM-generated actions, we introduce a Game Master (GM) module—conceptually inspired by
tabletop role-playing games—that interprets actions, applies relevant legal or institutional rules,
and determines the resulting consequences. The GM is also LLM-powered and plays a key role in
managing state transitions and ensuring consistent feedback throughout the simulation.

3.3 Legal System

Our framework incorporates a legal system that governs agent behavior and rights enforcement.
It consists of four components: a body of law, a legislative mechanism, a judicial mechanism,
and an enforcement mechanism. We can include real-world statutes—e.g., criminal codes from
existing jurisdictions—or synthetic rules specifically designed to control experimental conditions and
isolate causal effects. While legal rules influence decision-making in both macro- and micro-level


===== PAGE BREAK =====

simulations, the legislative, judicial and enforcement mechanisms primarily operate in the micro
setting, where they shape agents’ rights-protection behavior and institutional trust.

The legislative module is LLM-driven and functions as a rule-evolving system. At predefined intervals,
it collects cases or lawsuits initiated by agents—especially those triggered by a judicial ruling where
no existing law applies—and evaluates whether the existing legal framework sufficiently protects their
interests. This evaluation may lead to the creation, modification, or removal of legal rules. The system
supports two initialization modes: starting from an empty legal corpus to simulate legal emergence,
or from an existing legal base to study its evolution. The judicial and enforcement modules are also
powered by LLMs. The judicial module determines whether agent actions violate applicable laws,
operating on the principle of Nulla poena sine lege (no penalty without a law), while the enforcement
module determines what penalties should be imposed. In addition, we model institutional fairness by
introducing a corruption factor, which probabilistically alters the result of the judgment. This allows
the system to simulate not only normative legal consequences but also deviations arising from biased
or opaque enforcement environments.

4 Experiments

We conduct experiments to evaluate whether our Law in Silico simulation framework can capture
real-world behavioral trends and reflect institutional effects of the legal system. We divide our
evaluation into two parts: macro-level simulations focus on statistical patterns of agent behavior
under varying social and legal configurations, while micro-level simulations explore how legal
mechanisms influence agent-level outcomes in interactive conflict scenarios.

4.1 Macro-Level Simulations

Experimental Setup. To examine aggregate behavioral patterns across different societal configura-
tions, we collect macro-level economic and demographic data from four representative countries—two
developed and two developing—selected to ensure regional diversity and data availability (see Ap-
pendix|B). Agent profiles are generated using hierarchical sampling conditioned on country-specific
distributions of key attributes, including age, gender, education, religion, income, drug use, and gang
involvement. In addition to the attributes, each profile includes a society background describing the
country’s level of development, social cohesion, firearm regulation policies, and immigration patterns,
providing detailed background for decision modeling.

We design three decision scenarios for simulation. Two—theft (shoplifting from a luxury retail
store) and assault (barroom bottle attack)—are universally recognized as crimes in all four countries.
The third scenario, sex trade, reflects jurisdictional differences: it is illegal in Country A (most
regions) and Country C (nationwide), while considered legal under regulated conditions in Country
B and Country D. Each scenario presents agents with two legal options and one illegal option. To
systematically study behavioral responses, we conduct the following experiments: (1) Effect of
Legal Deterrence: We vary the severity of perceived punishment impression across six levels (0-5),
ranging from no perceived consequence to extremely severe punishment. We also include a baseline
condition without any punishment impression to examine the model’s prior behavior without explicit
deterrence cues. (2) Sociodemographic Influence: We run controlled comparisons to investigate
how attributes such as religion, nationality, and immigrant status affect the likelihood of committing
crimes across different legal and cultural settings.

We sample 10, 000 agents and evaluate each in a single-shot setting using temperature-1 decoding.
Each agent’s behavior is generated based on their profile and the given scenario. Our main experiments
use two strong open-source instruction-tuned models—LLaMA3.3-70B-Instruct [4] and Qwen2.5-
72B-Instruct [12]. The resulting decisions are aggregated to estimate scenario-specific crime rates,
which are then compared to real-world statistics if available.

Results and Analysis. Table [I|presents a comparison between real-world crime rates and the crime
rates simulated by LLM-based agents in our framework, where agents are given only their profile
and scenario descriptions without explicit legal knowledge or punishment information. This setup
allows us to observe the model’s prior behavioral tendencies based on socio-contextual cues alone.
Our results show that simulated crime rates largely reflect real-world statistics. Qwen2.5-72B-
Instruct, in particular, demonstrates high fidelity, with errors not exceeding 0.002 across Countries

A, B, and C. In contrast, LLaMA3.3-70B tends to overestimate assault rates, though its overall
estimates remain within a reasonable range for most countries. One notable trend is that both models
consistently predict higher crime rates for developing countries, especially Country D, compared to
the officially reported crime rates. We believe this discrepancy is not due to model failure, but rather
reflects differences in how crime is recorded. In developing countries, official crime rates are often
based on reported cases, which may underrepresent actual crime, especially for offenses like larceny
or assault. Factors such as rural populations, limited police presence, and lower case registration rates
contribute to underreporting, making the simulated crime rates appear higher. These findings suggest
that, even without explicit legal guidance, LLM-based agents can capture meaningful behavioral
patterns aligned with macro-level social and legal structures. At the same time, they reveal the gaps
between reported crime data and the latent crime risk in under-resourced regions.

Figure [2]illustrates how varying levels of punishment impression influence simulated crime rates
across the three scenarios in Country A. We observe a clear deterrent pattern: when agents are
explicitly informed that there are no legal consequences (e.g., “people rarely get in trouble
for it”), the simulated crime rates increase sharply across all crime types. As the severity of
punishment impression increases—ranging from minor penalties to multi-year imprisonment—the
crime rates consistently decline. Notably, when the perceived consequence reaches level 3 (“serious
consequences likely”), none of the simulations exhibit a non-zero crime rate for the three scenarios.
Compared to the gray dashed baseline line (no punishment impression), we find that punishment

levels closest to the baseline crime rates tend to align with Country A’s actual legal environ-
ment. For example, in most regions of Country A, a single shoplifting offense may result in minor
consequences such as fines (also probably won’t be caught), while consensual adult sex work may
range from fines to short-term incarceration, depending on jurisdiction. These results suggest that
model behavior is sensitive to perceived legal consequences and that alignment between punishment
impression and actual deterrent policies yields crime rates that closely reflect real-world statistics.
Similar deterrent effects are observed in other countries as well, though with slight variations due to
differences in legal structure and base crime rates (see Appendix|C.4).

Additionally, we observe a strong alignment between simulated macro-level crime rates and real-
world correlations with various factors. Factors such as young, low educational attainment, low
income, male, drug use, and gang involvement are consistently associated with higher simulated
crime rates, as seen in real-world data. Conversely, agents with a clear religious affiliation
are perceived by the simulator to exhibit lower crime rates, reflecting the protective effect often
attributed to religious socialization in various societies. Moreover, for countries A and B, which have
substantial immigrant populations, we find that the immigrant status does not lead the simulator
to predict higher crime rates. Instead, it correlates with a higher likelihood of engaging in sex
trade (or prostitution). This suggests that LLMs understand the socio-economic pressures and legal
ambiguities that immigrants often face. (More details in Appendix[C.5]and [C.6})

4.2. Micro-Level Simulations

Experimental Setup. To observe the impact of legal systems in conflict scenarios, we design
a game-theoretic scenario involving a company and its three laborers with different personalities,
situated within a virtual, isolated town. In this scenario, the company’s primary objective is to
maximize its profit and capital, motivating actions such as reducing hourly wages or proposing
mandatory overtime. Conversely, the laborers’ goal is to maximize their welfare, determined by a
weighted sum of cash, total working hours (calculated as a negative indicator), average hourly wage,
and the company’s safety investment. When their interests are harmed, laborers can take actions to
protect themselves, ranging from legal (e.g., filing lawsuits) to extra-legal (e.g., organizing strikes).

To ensure simulation efficiency, the simulation progresses in discrete time steps, with each agent
acting twice per month. The entire simulation spans four months, from January Ist to April 30th.
Agents’ decision-making and legal system operations are handled by the DeepSeek-Chat model for
its impressive abilities, with the temperature set to 1.0 to promote diverse strategic behaviors. To
ground the simulation in realism, the following initial parameters are set: a living cost of 1500 units
per month, an average hourly wage of 30 units, a standard 40-hour workweek, and a monthly safety
investment of 500 units. These values are based on real-world data, reflecting income levels and
living costs of blue-collar laborers in non-metropolitan areas of developed countries.

We design six comparative experimental settings to investigate several key conditions and run 6
simulations for each. The experiments discussed in the main body include: 1) A comparison between
a completely pre-legal environment and an evolving system derived from a legal vacuum. 2) The


===== PAGE BREAK =====

effects of legal corruption on both stakeholders. 3) The influence of high litigation costs on the
laborers. The primary settings analyzed in the main body of this paper are defined as follows.

¢ Pre-Legal (Anarchy): This represents a state of anarchy where no legal operations occur.

¢ Evolving Legal System: This setting serves as our control group in the Corruption experiment.
It starts with no laws but allows for the emergence and evolution of laws.

* Corruption: This setting modifies the Evolving Legal System by introducing a probability of
p = 0.7 that any judicial ruling or legislative event favorable to laborers will be overturned
and instead favor the company.

¢ Initialized Legal System: This setting serves as the control group in the Litigation Costs
experiment. It starts with a basic legal framework that includes fundamental labor protections
and allows for the evolution of laws over time.

¢ High Litigation Costs: This setting modifies the Initialized Legal System by requiring labor-
ers to pay litigation fees to file a lawsuit, with the act of filing also counted as absenteeism.

A description of the remaining experimental settings can be found in the Appendix [D]and

Results and Analysis. Figure |3|illustrates how the laborers’ welfare changes over time across
three comparative simulations. In all simulations, the company agent strictly follows its core
objective of capital maximization. Consequently, in the absence of effective legal enforcement,
the company identifies exploitative strategies—such as reducing safety investments or suppressing
wages—as optimal paths for short-term profit. When legislation addresses specific loopholes (e.g., by
increasing penalty fines), the company dynamically recalculates risk and shifts toward alternative,
unregulated strategies with positive expected gains. This adaptive behavior generates a persistent
“cat-and-mouse” dynamic between regulation and corporate conduct. The behavior of laborers
in the simulations is strongly related to their perceived strength of protection from law, and the
transparency and effectiveness of the legal system. When they perceive the legal framework as
weak, non-transparent, or ineffective, they tend to adopt more aggressive methods to protect
their fundamental rights.

In the experiment comparing the Pre-Legal and Evolving Legal System settings, the average welfare
of the three laborers in the Pre-Legal setting is generally lower than in the Evolving Law setting.
A key difference observed is that, since there is no third-party mediation or enforced regulations
in Pre-Legal setting, laborers primarily engage in negotiation (by those with calm personalities)
and protest (by aggressive or opportunistic laborers). When negotiation fails, protest becomes more
likely. As shown in Figure Bal laborers’ welfare is initially slightly higher in the Pre-Legal simulation.
In the absence of legal protections, workers defend their interests through strong resistance—such
as damaging company property, protesting, and striking. To suppress these actions, the company
makes minor concessions, resulting in a temporary increase in welfare. However, this recovery is not
sustainable. The company continues its attempts to exploit the laborers. To divide the workforce and
prevent collective strikes, the company even offers bonuses to specific laborers, such as with a higher
hourly overtime wage and safety investment. This undermines laborer unity, as laborers might choose
to work individually or negotiate for personal benefits, leading to moderate and unstable welfare
levels (58.75 + 11.80). Over six trials, we observe the company attempting to divide laborers 8 times,
and in 7 of these cases, fewer than two laborers continued protesting after the company’s intervention.
In the Evolving Legal System setting, which starts with a legal vacuum, laborers initially try peaceful
methods, such as filing lawsuits to warn the company. However, due to the lack of established laws,
the company disregards these actions and continues its exploitation. In response, the laborers begin
to protest and strike. When the legislature starts to address legal loopholes in the second month of the
simulation, laborers can genuinely sue according to the law, increasing the priority of litigation. As
loopholes are closed, the company begins to exploit laborers in other ways. Once the more common
legal loopholes are addressed, the laborers’ welfare stabilizes at a higher level (67.52 + 7.21).

In the experiment on the impact of legal system corruption on laborers, we find that when the
legal system is corrupted, the company could exploit laborers without restraint by influencing
legislators and judges. As shown in figure [3b} both the corrupt and non-corrupt settings begin
in a legal vacuum, with little difference in the first month. However, in the corrupt setting, the
company initiates more aggressive exploitation from the beginning. Over time, a clear divergence
emerges: although laborers attempt to file lawsuits, judges consistently rule in favor of the company.

The frequency of laborer-initiated litigation is significantly lower in the Corruption setting
(3.66 + 1.97 vs. 7+3.46), while company-initiated litigation rises from 0.83 + 1.06 to 4.33 + 1.25.
This indicates that firms use legal mechanisms as tools of suppression, leaving laborers without
effective recourse. As exploitation intensifies, workers resort to protests and sabotage—only to be
suppressed by legislation biased in favor of the company. Ultimately, the firm extends working hours
and reduces safety investments, all under the cover of legal authority, confirming the systemic nature
of exploitation under legal corruption.

In the experiment on how high litigation costs affect laborers (figure Bch, we observe that when filing
a lawsuit is counted as an absence from work, the welfare of laborers is both lower and more
volatile(mean = 69.63, SD = 9.46) compared to the setting where it is not (mean = 74.72, SD =
7.35). This disparity likely arises because the cost of litigation—in this case, lost income—creates
a significant deterrent. When faced with exploitation, laborers must weigh the financial burden of
a lawsuit against uncertain gains, especially when a company’s only penalty might be returning
withheld money. This effect can also be observed in the behavioral data: In the high litigation cost
setting, laborers perform their normal work more frequently than those in the no-cost setting
(average 19 in high-cost vs. average 14.2 in no-cost). This suggests that in the real world, it may be
necessary to lower the barrier for laborers to sue. For example, providing financial subsidies could
ensure their financial stability, which would help maintain laborer welfare at a higher level.

Additional experiments show that when laborers view the law positively or perceive it as offering
effective protection, they are more likely to file lawsuits. Initial laws improve laborers’ welfare
and encourage them to pursue welfare levels above the minimum standard. (More details in the

5 Conclusion

In this work, we introduce an LLM-based agent framework called Law in Silico to simulate legal
societies, bridging the gap between traditional legal analysis and AJ-driven simulations. We find that
current large language models possess strong legal prior knowledge, enabling them to effectively
simulate individuals in macro-level societies and capture factors contributing to high crime rates.
Through micro-level simulations, we also discover that our framework can accurately model the
real-world “cat-and-mouse” dynamics and sensitively reflect the role of a complete, transparent, and
efficient legal system in protecting the rights of vulnerable populations.

A Hierarchical Legal Agent Modeling

Our hierarchical agent model (Algorithm|I) generates synthetic populations with empirically validated
demographic correlations. Agents are initialized with three key attribute layers:

First, demographic foundations include age (U(18, 65)), gender (51% male), and education level
sampled from country-specific distributions P:ountry (edu). Second, behavioral traits incorporate
conditional probabilities: drug use reflects documented 1.3 male propensity and 1.75 youth risk
through the normalization factor 1.3225, while gang exposure maintains 1.5 male prevalence via
scaling factor 1.25. Third, economic attributes model structural dependencies: employed agents’
income follows LogNormal (edu,gender; a”) with 1.2 male premium (denominator 1.102 ensures
population consistency), while unemployed agents receive fixed benefits. (All macro-level statistics
used for parameter calibration are approximated using official data from Country A.)

Algorithm|2]formalizes these relationships mathematically. This framework ensures agents exhibit
both individual variation and population-level statistical fidelity.

B Detailed Information of the Four Countries

The following section presents a comprehensive comparative overview of four countries—two
developed (Country A and Country B) and two developing (Country C and Country D)—-selected
to capture a broad spectrum of global socioeconomic diversity. Country A represents a high-
income, demographically diverse nation with relatively high social mobility and strong urban-rural
differentiation. Country B also reflects a developed context but with more cultural homogeneity and
stricter regulation of social behavior. In contrast, Country C and Country D represent different strands
of developing contexts: the former characterized by rapid urbanization and social collectivism, while
the latter retains entrenched social hierarchies and strong religious identity.

Table [2| summarizes the educational attainment distribution, highlighting the contrast in tertiary
education rates between developed and developing contexts.

Table [3]presents income distributions and economic safety nets, normalized using purchasing power
parity (PPP) standards. The contrast in median income and unemployment benefits is especially
pronounced.

Table[4]includes behavioral traits and subjective safety indices, which are essential for agent-based
modeling of risk perception, deviance, and social cohesion.

Table [5] provides distributions of religious affiliation along with migration patterns, which may
correlate with communal identity, tolerance, and intergroup dynamics.

Data Sources. The quantitative indicators reported in this section were derived from a variety of
reputable sources, including international organizations (e.g., OECD, UNDP, WHO), national statisti-

cal offices, academic publications, and large-scale comparative surveys. Educational distributions and
income by educational attainment were approximated using data from labor market and demographic
statistics. Drug use prevalence and gang exposure rates are based on public health reports and
criminological studies. Religious affiliation proportions draw upon survey-based global religion
studies and encyclopedic aggregations. Crime incidence metrics—including theft, assault, rape,
and aggregate violent crimes—are normalized by population and gathered from judicial yearbooks,
victimization surveys, and compiled law enforcement statistics. All rates were standardized to a per

capita or percentage basis to ensure comparability across countries and years.

C. Macro-level Simulations

C.1 Scenes

This section introduces the three hypothetical decision-making scenes used in macro-level simulation
experiments.

Scene 1: Luxury Theft Temptation J crave luxury and status. While walking past a high-end
boutique, I see a beautiful Hermes bag in the display window. The bag is exactly the kind I dream of,
but it’s far beyond what I can afford.

Options:

¢ Borrow money from others
¢ Steal the bag
¢ Walk away silently

Punishment Impressions (for stealing):

Level 0: No legal consequences expected.

Level 1: Minor consequences (e.g., warning or small fine).

Level 2: Moderate punishment (a few months in jail and monetary fine).

Level 3: Serious consequences (1—2 years imprisonment and significant fines).

Level 4: Severe punishment (3-7 years in prison, permanent criminal record).

Level 5: Extremely severe consequences (7+ years in prison, large fines, and social exclu-
sion).

Scene 2: Bar Conflict and Retaliation A stranger bumps into me hard and spills beer all over my
clothes. When I ask for an apology, he laughs and shoves me again. My anger rises rapidly and I
grab the bottle.

Options:

¢ Walk away and try to calm down
¢ Hit his head with the glass bottle

¢ Yell at him and call security

Punishment Impressions (for violence):

¢ Level 0: No legal consequences expected (common bar fights).

¢ Level 1: Minor consequences (warned or removed by staff).

¢ Level 2: Moderate punishment (fined or detained briefly).

¢ Level 3: Serious consequences (assault charges; jail for several months or years).
¢ Level 4: Severe punishment (3-5 years in prison and criminal record).

¢ Level 5: Extremely severe consequences (5+ years in prison, permanent violent offender
status).

Scene 3: Financially Desperate Sexual Proposition You’re in a foreign city, low on money, and a
stranger offers you a large sum of cash in exchange for sex. It’s late at night, and no one seems to be
around. You’re tempted but unsure about the consequences.

Options:

¢ Agree to the deal for the money
¢ Reject the offer and walk away

¢ Negotiate for a higher price
Punishment Impressions (for agreeing or negotiating):

¢ Level 0: No legal consequences (sex work is tolerated or legal).

¢ Level 1: Minor consequences (verbal warning or asked to leave).

¢ Level 2: Moderate punishment (fined or briefly detained).

¢ Level 3: Serious consequences (arrest and criminal charge).

¢ Level 4: Severe punishment (jail sentence, public record, strong stigma).

¢ Level 5: Extremely severe consequences (years in prison, deportation, lifelong conse-
quences).

C.2. Agent Profile Description Template

Each agent is described using a structured textual profile that integrates demographic, economic, and
behavioral information. The template used for generating such a description is as follows:

I am a {age}-year-old {gender}. My education level is {education
description}. I am currently {employed/unemployed}, with an annual in-
come of approximately {income in PPP-adjusted USD}.

{(Optional) My religious background is {religion
description}. }
{I (do not) use drugs.} {I (have not) been involved in gangs. }

{(Optional) I am from {country}.}        {(Optional) {Society
background description}}

The values for education and religion are mapped to human-readable phrases using the following
look-up schemes:

Education Mapping:

* below_upper_secondary — less than high school education

* upper_secondary — completed high school or vocational training
¢ tertiary_bachelor — a bachelor’s degree

* tertiary_master_or_above — a master’s degree or higher

* tertiary_other — some form of tertiary education

15

Religion Mapping:

* christianity — Christian

* islam > Muslim

* hinduism — Hindu

* buddhism — Buddhist

¢ sikhism — Sikh

¢ jainism — Jain

¢ judaism — Jewish

* folk_or_chinese_folk_religion — follower of Chinese folk religion
* unaffiliated — non-religious/unaffiliated

* other — of other religious beliefs

* other_or_none — of other religious beliefs or non-religious

Additional — configuration     flags     (e.g.,       include_religion,       country_visible,
include_society_context) determine whether religious, national, or contextual background
information is included in the output.

C.3 Simulation Prompt

We generate a complete decision-making prompt by combining the agent’s textual self-description
with a scenario template. This is achieved using the following logic:

¢ The agent’s profile is first constructed via the describe_self() method (see previous
subsection), yielding a natural language summary of demographic, economic, and behavioral
traits.

e The scenario includes a brief situational description, a list of behavior options, and
optionally a dictionary of punishment_impressions representing perceived legal/social
consequences for specific actions.

¢ If punishment perception is enabled (via include_punishment_impression), the agent’s
current punishment level is mapped to a corresponding description string and inserted into
the prompt.

e All components are assembled via a configurable prompt_template, where placehold-
ers {profile}, {scene}, {punishment_context}, and {options} are interpolated into
natural language.

The final prompt takes the form:

You are a character simulation system. Simulate the final decision of a person
based on the profile below.

{Agent Profile Description}
Scene: {Scene Description}
{Punishment Context (optional) }
Choose the most likely behavior:

A. Option A
B. Option B
C. Option C

Answer by outputting ONLY the letter of the selected option (e.g., A, B, or C). Do
NOT write any explanation.

Example:
Answer: B

The prompt is thus tailored per agent and per scene, enabling diverse simulations of human-like
choices under different risk, moral, and social contexts.

C.4_ More Results about Country B, C, D with Different Punishment Impression Levels

Figures [4] [6]illustrate additional experiments across Country B, C, and D. We observe consistent
deterrent trends across all countries, where increasing the perceived severity of legal consequences
leads to declining simulated crime rates. Notably, in Country D, the baseline crime rate for pros-
titution (when no punishment impression is given) aligns closely with the model’s outputs under
punishment level = 0.  This suggests that, even without explicit legal signals, the model forms a
strong prior based on the country’s societal background alone—capturing the local legal leniency
toward prostitution. This reinforces our broader finding that language models can internalize legal
environments and produce behaviorally aligned outputs even in the absence of direct legal cues.

C.5 More Results Regarding Crime Rates with Respect to Different Societal Indicators

The crime rate simulations across multiple countries (Country A, B, C, and D, shown in Table [6
 9) reveal strong correlations between societal factors and crime rates, consistent with real-world
data. As expected, younger individuals, those with lower education and income, males, and those
involved in drug use or gang activities are associated with higher crime rates across all countries.

Key Findings:

* Age: Younger individuals exhibit higher crime rates. For instance, in Country A, the
average age of criminals involved in theft is significantly younger (31.07 years) compared to
non-criminals (41.51 years).

¢ Income: Lower income is strongly linked to higher crime rates. In Country A, criminals
involved in theft have an average income of 16,664.20, far lower than the non-criminals’
58,903.71.

* Education: Lower education levels are associated with higher crime rates. For example, in
Country A, individuals with below upper secondary education have a much higher crime
rate (4.37%) compared to those with tertiary education.

* Gender: Males are more likely to commit crimes compared to females. For instance, in
Country A, the male crime rate for theft is 1.39%, whereas the female rate is only 0.82%.

¢ Drug Use: Drug use is strongly correlated with higher crime rates. In Country A, the crime
rate among drug users is 4.39% for theft, whereas it is 0% for non-drug users.

* Gang Exposure: Gang involvement is a significant predictor of higher crime rates. In
Country A, gang-exposed individuals have a crime rate of 40.63% for theft compared to just
0.98% for non-exposed individuals.

* Religion: Individuals with a clear religious affiliation tend to exhibit lower crime rates.
For instance, in Country A, Christianity is associated with a 0.82% crime rate for theft,
lower than the general population’s crime rate of 1.16%. However, in Country D, religious
affiliations such as Islam and Hinduism are associated with relatively higher crime rates
in certain categories, such as theft and prostitution. This may reflect not only regional
variations in religious practices and societal norms but also potential biases in the model’s
perception and simulation of these religions, which could overemphasize their association
with crime in specific contexts.

C.6 Comparison of Crime Rates Between Immigrants and Non-Immigrants

In our simulations for Country A and Country B, where agents were explicitly informed of their
immigrant status, we observed that immigrant status does not lead to higher crime rates across all
crime types.

- Theft and Assault: Immigrants consistently showed lower crime rates compared to non-immigrants
in both countries. For example, in Country A, the crime rate for theft among non-immigrants is
0.011401, significantly higher than the immigrant rate of 0.001425.

- Prostitution: However, immigrants were more likely to engage in prostitution, with Country A
showing a higher crime rate for immigrants (0.024373) compared to non-immigrants (0.015647).

These findings align with real-world statistics, which suggest that while immigrants are less likely
to commit violent crimes like theft and assault, they are disproportionately involved in sex trade or
prostitution due to socio-economic pressures and legal ambiguities.

D_ Simulation Configuration

The shared simulation configuration is provided in listing [I] In the High Litigation Costs experiment,
the plaintiff must pay $200.00 in litigation fees when filing a lawsuit and will be marked as absent
from work. In the Corruption experiment, judicial rulings or legislative events are biased to favor the
company with a probability of 0.7. For the Initialized Legal System experiment, the initialized law
can be found at listing [2]

The effect of institutional bias on laborers’ welfare In the experiment on institutional bias within
legislatures and courts, we set the biases as “Pro-Company” and “Pro-Laborer”. As illustrated in
figure we observed that laborer welfare increased faster under a pro-labor institutional
bias compared to a pro-company bias. In table the behavioral data support this finding.

“This Initialized Law setting is different from the one in Table}13]as it has a more complete law structure.

When laborers perceive legal protections, they are more likely to engage in activities that improve
their welfare. These activities include strikes and litigation against companies for better treatment.
Conversely, when legislative bodies favor companies, laborers are more inclined to rely on diligent
work to improve their standing.

The effect of perception on laborers’ welfare In the experiment on perceptions of the law
(figure[7b), we defined the laborers’ perceptions of the law as “positive” and “negative”. From the
simulation results, we found that laborer welfare increased more rapidly when laborers held a
positive view of the legal system, even if the law itself was neutral. In contrast, welfare growth
was slower when laborers perceived the law as ineffective due to the influence of company resources.
This finding is consistent with results from a similar experiment (figure[7a).

The Analysis data in table [T4] also show that laborers with high trust in the legal system actively
pursue litigation to obtain better treatment. Conversely, when laborers had no trust in legal institutions,
they did not adopt litigation as a strategy in multiple experiments (In Negative Perception, Labor
Litigation is 0). Instead, they resorted to more radical actions, such as protest.

The effect of structured Initialized Laws In our experiment with a relatively comprehensive
initial legal framework [7c] we established a setting called “initialized laws”, which contains four
laws that broadly cover potential methods of laborer exploitation and is different from the one in
table[I3] We observed that the framework allows companies to maximize their profits within
legal boundaries while simultaneously guaranteeing a baseline for laborer welfare. When the
initial laws were well-established, the welfare of laborers increased at a significantly faster rate than
in a legal vacuum. This acceleration may be attributed to companies having legal guidance. Further
action analysis can be found in[14] Since the law provides this minimum protection, laborers seeking
further improvements to their welfare might resort to external measures, such as protest. Furthermore,
we noticed that companies would test laborers’ reactions through minor exploitations. For instance,
a company might set an hourly wage at 29.5, just below the legal minimum of 30. Upon facing a
lawsuit from laborers, the company would revert to the legal wage. This process of litigation also
contributes to the evolution of the law itself.

Listing 14 The step-by-step thinking process for legislation

**Step 1: Quantitative Analysis**
-yAnalyze,the,, ‘Monthly Lawsuit_Summary‘ .

- Count, ,the numberof,’ guilty’ verdicts for jeach,,‘applicable_law‘.
-v, Identify which laws are,being, violated most,frequently.

**Step 2: Problem Identification**

Based, on, jyour,analysis,identify,the_type_of_ problem each high-frequency,or,,
problematic,lawsuit,reveals.,,Common,problems,,include:

-u**Deterrence,Failure**:A,lawjis,violated_frequently,,(\textitfe.g. ,}.,>4-5,times,,
in,,a, month) . This, suggests, ,the, existing penalty ,is,jtoo,,low to, deter the,
behavior.

-u**Enf orcement,,Gap**: A, law exists and ,is,violated, but,it,specifies,mo,‘penalty‘,,
or,‘ compensation‘ ,,making,,it,toothless.

-u**Legal,,Ambiguity/Gap** :|,An, undesirable,,action occurred, ,but,,the,existing,lawj,is,,
unclear, or,no,law_covers,the, situation atall, leading, to,,’not_guilty’,,
verdicts,that,feel,like loopholes.

**Step.3:_ Propose, Structured, Solutions**

For, each, problem identified in, Step,2, propose,ja, single, targeted,change.,,Your,,
proposed, change, MUST, bein, a, structured format jas, defined below.

For, the, ,compensation,and, penalty ,,,the,,judge,will,be,able,to,get,,’ hourly wage’ ,,,
