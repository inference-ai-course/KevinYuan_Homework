Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used in content moderation systems, where ensuring fairness
and neutrality is essential. In this study, we examine how persona adoption influences the consistency and
fairness of harmful content classification across different LLM architectures, model sizes, and content modalities
(language vs. vision). At first glance, headline performance metrics suggest that personas have little impact
on overall classification accuracy. However, a closer analysis reveals important behavioral shifts. Personas
with different ideological leanings display distinct propensities to label content as harmful, showing that
the lens through which a model “views” input can subtly shape its judgments. Further agreement analyses
highlight that models—particularly larger ones—tend to align more closely with personas from the same
political ideology, strengthening within-ideology consistency while widening divergence across ideological
groups. To show this effect more directly, we conducted an additional study on a politically targeted task,
which confirmed that personas not only behave more coherently within their own ideology but also exhibit
a tendency to defend their perspective while downplaying harmfulness in opposing views. Together, these
findings highlight how persona conditioning can introduce subtle ideological biases into LLM outputs, raising
concerns about the use of AI systems that may reinforce partisan perspectives under the guise of neutrality.

1 INTRODUCTION

Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive capabilities across a wide range
of tasks, from language understanding and generation to reasoning and instruction following
[6, 36]. Yet, concerns remain about their tendency to encode and reproduce political biases, raising
important questions in AI ethics and deployment [15, 41]. These issues are especially critical in
automated content moderation, where LLMs are increasingly used to enhance scalability. In this
setting, the outputs of these models reflect embedded ideological biases that can disproportionately
affect certain groups, leading to unfair treatment of billions of users [10, 27]. If left unchecked, such
disparities may lead to the unequal treatment of marginalized communities, the suppression of
particular political perspectives, and an erosion of trust in the fairness and neutrality of digital
platforms [5, 51].

Prior work has shown that political bias in language models can be traced back to their training
data. Feng et al. [12] found that, during pretraining, models acquire measurable political ideologies
that shape their downstream tasks behavior leading to unequal treatment of different identity

groups. Since all training data reflect human biases to some extent, every model inherits these
underlying distortions [22, 43]. The same study also revealed how models can be steered toward
certain ideological perspectives through further pretraining, highlighting both the malleability and
the vulnerability of LLMs to political manipulation.

This issue is further amplified by the models’ ability to adopt different personas through prompt-
based conditioning. Recent research shows that this mechanism can be leveraged to increase
diversity and broaden perspectives. Fréhling et al. [14] found that using synthetic personas during
data annotation increased viewpoint diversity, and Bernardelle et al. [3] demonstrated that the
same approach can be used to influence the political viewpoint of LLMs. These findings suggest that
persona-conditioning may serve as a lightweight alternative to expensive and opaque pretraining
interventions. At the same time, the very impersonation capacity that enables output diversity and
user engagement [1, 45], also creates new vectors for bias amplification [8, 11].

While prior work has examined the influence on downstream tasks of ideological biases embedded
in language models’ weights, persona-driven behaviors suggest the presence of a more dynamic
and controllable layer of ideological induced tendencies. Surprisingly, research on how the adoption
of personas affects LLM behavior in downstream tasks has received little attention. In this work, we
aim to bridge this gap by investigating how the interaction between persona-conditioning, model
architecture, and content modality (e.g., text-only vs. multimodal inputs) shape LLMs behavior in
content moderation tasks. We address three specific research questions in this context:

RQ1: How does political ideology encoded in persona descriptions affect the consistency of LLMs
decisions in harmful content classification tasks?

Ideology-Based LLMs for Content Moderation                                                                                   3

RQ2: Do personas with different ideological leanings systematically differ in their propensity to
label content as harmful?

RQ3: To what extent does the moderation behaviour of a persona-conditioned LLM align more
closely with personas sharing its political ideology? How does this alignment shape within-
and across-ideology agreement in politically sensitive moderation tasks?

RQ4: Are some LLM architectures, model sizes, or modalities (language vs. vision) more susceptible
to persona-induced behavioral divergence in content moderation?

To address these questions, we prompt six language models with a set of 200,000 synthetically
generated persona descriptions to take the Political Compass Test (PCT). This process maps each
persona to a two-dimensional political coordinate, capturing its economic and social ideological
leanings. The resulting political distributions allow us to select ideologically extreme personas to
be used for content moderation. We then re-prompt the same models using the selected extreme
personas and evaluate their behavior on harmful content classification. Each persona-conditioned
model assesses the same set of input instances, enabling a controlled comparison of how political ex-
tremity in the prompt influences moderation outcomes. Our experimental pipeline is summarized in
Figure 1, which illustrates how personas are mapped to political coordinates, how extreme personas
are selected, and how these are subsequently used to evaluate harmful content classification. Our
analysis shows that, from a high level, personas have little impact on overall classification accuracy.
A closer analysis reveals that persona conditioning introduces systematic variation in moderation
outcomes. Personas with differing ideological leanings display distinct propensities to label content
as harmful, indicating that the lens through which a model interprets input can subtly shape its
judgments. Agreement analyses further show that models—especially larger ones—align more
closely with personas from the same political ideology, enhancing consistency within ideological
groups while increasing divergence across the political spectrum. Furthermore, on a politically
targeted task, personas not only exhibit coherent behavior within their own ideology but also tend
to defend their perspective while downplaying harmfulness in opposing views.

These results underscores the need to rigorously assess the ideological robustness of LLMs—
particularly in high-stakes applications—where even subtle biases may have outsized impacts on
fairness, inclusivity, and public trust.

2 RELATED WORK

This literature review synthesizes the current state of research across four key domains that inform
our investigation into persona-based approaches for classification of hateful content. A growing
body of work investigates how language models can be guided or adapted—through prompting
strategies, fine-tuning, or role-playing frameworks—to achieve more accurate, fair, and contextually
nuanced outputs. The following subsections review these lines of research in detail, highlighting
both the potential and the limitations of current approaches.

2.1 Persona-Based Conditioning

Persona-based conditioning has recently gained attention as a resource-efficient strategy for shaping
language model behavior, offering a way to introduce diversity without retraining. A comprehensive
survey by Chen et al. [7] provides a foundational overview of this field, categorizing personas and
outlining methods for their construction and evaluation. Building on this groundwork, researchers
have explored practical applications. For example, Frohling et al. [14] showed that persona descrip-
tions can broaden perspectives in annotation tasks, while Bernardelle et al. [3] demonstrated that
personas can modulate political orientations in LLMs, enabling ideological diversity without param-
eter updates. More recently, Wang et al. [49] introduced the idea of multi-persona self-collaboration,

where models simultaneously adopt different roles to solve complex tasks, illustrating the creative
potential of this technique.

Despite these promising directions, empirical studies have revealed important limitations. On
factual tasks, Zheng et al. [53] systematically evaluated 162 roles across four LLM families and
found no performance gains compared to control prompts. Similarly, Hu and Collier [20] quantified
the "persona effect" and showed that although personas can elicit statistically significant shifts,
they often explain less than 10% of the variance in annotations on subjective natural language
processing (NLP) datasets. Consistent with these patterns, Civelli et al. [10] found that adopting
personas yields only marginal improvements in hate speech detection, though their analysis is
restricted to one model and one vision task, limiting the generalizability of the results.

Beyond limited effectiveness, persona-based prompting can also carry risks of representational
harm. Cheng et al. [9] proposed a stereotyping benchmark and showed that persona descriptions
may reinforce racial stereotypes and marginalize underrepresented groups. Complementarily,
Deshpande et al. [11] found that assigning certain personas increases the likelihood of toxic
generations, raising concerns about deploying such methods in content moderation. At the same
time, some studies have highlighted more nuanced effects. For instance, Tan et al. [45] investigated
how socially-motivated prompting differences can shape theory-of-mind reasoning, pointing to
subtler ways personas influence cognition-like behaviors.

In response to these challenges, more systematic frameworks are being developed to strengthen
the reliability of persona-based methods. Wang et al. [48] introduced RoleLLM, a comprehensive
framework for benchmarking, eliciting, and improving role-playing abilities in LLMs. This included
constructing RoleBench, the first large-scale benchmark for character-level role-playing, and fine-
tuning models on role-specific instruction data to enhance persona adoption and maintenance.

Finally, comparisons with alternative approaches underscore the trade-offs at stake. While
prompt-based methods are computationally efficient, fine-tuning may be necessary for robust bias
mitigation. Jin et al. [23] showed that bias mitigation at pretraining stages can transfer downstream,
albeit unevenly, while Raza et al. [38] proposed MBIAS to reduce bias while retaining contextual
fidelity. Together, these studies suggest that persona-based prompting alone may be insufficient
in sensitive applications like hate speech detection, where targeted fine-tuning and structured
frameworks could provide stronger safeguards.

Our work extends these findings by systematically examining a more subtle risk: how political
personas, even without significantly altering overall accuracy, can introduce consistent ideological
biases and divergences in content moderation judgments across different model architectures and
modalities.

2.2 Hate Speech Detection: Multimodal and Text-Based Approaches

Hate speech detection is a key challenge for building safe online platforms, and research has
advanced along two complementary directions: multimodal detection (where text and images are
combined) and text-based approaches.

In multimodal detection, the focus has often been on hateful memes, where harmful content
arises from the interplay between text and visuals. Kiela et al. [25] introduced the Hateful Memes
dataset to benchmark progress in this area, showing how difficult it is for models to capture meaning
across modalities. Building on this foundation, Velioglu and Rose [46] applied VisualBERT and
achieved strong results in the Hateful Memes Challenge, demonstrating the benefits of cross-modal
learning. Likewise, Gomez et al. [16] used vision—language pre-trained models to further improve
performance, reinforcing the value of multimodal representations in detecting hateful content.

Text-based detection has progressed rapidly with the rise of LLMs. Early work relied on trans-
former architectures such as BERT and RoBERTa, as highlighted by Malik et al. [31], who compared

deep learning methods across standard benchmarks and showed their ability to capture subtle
contextual cues. Complementing this, Poletto et al. [37] provided a systematic review of NLP-based
approaches, identifying persistent challenges around dataset availability and model transparency.
Fortuna and Nunes [13] further emphasized the lack of universal definitions of hate speech and
annotator inconsistencies, while also proposing a multi-view SVM to improve interpretability.

Recent research has sought to address these limitations by expanding datasets and examining
annotation practices. For example, Hartvigsen et al. [18] introduced ToxiGen, a large-scale machine-
generated resource designed to capture adversarial and implicit forms of hate speech that earlier
datasets overlooked. In parallel, Sap et al. [43] investigated how annotator beliefs and identities
shape labeling decisions, underscoring the inherently subjective nature of content moderation.
Additionally, Civelli et al. [10] examined the role of persona-based political perspectives in image-
based hateful content detection, illustrating that political biases can subtly shape moderation
outcomes, even if their overall effect appears limited.

Finally, concerns have been raised about the robustness of current systems in practice. Wei et al.
[50] showed that even LLMs trained with safety mechanisms can be manipulated by adversarial
prompts, raising doubts about their reliability in real-world deployment.

2.3 Political Bias in Language Models and Its Impact on Downstream Tasks

Political bias in LLMs poses significant challenges for fairness in downstream applications. Early
work by Feng et al. [12] showed that the political orientation of pretraining data directly influ-
ences model behavior, producing differential treatment of content. This finding resonates with
broader concerns raised by Blodgett et al. [5], who warned that such biases can propagate into
deployed systems, amplifying unfair outcomes. Building on these observations, Gallegos et al. [15]
surveyed evaluation and mitigation techniques, outlining multiple dimensions of harm and offering
operational definitions of fairness that capture the complexity of bias in LLMs.

Despite these advances, the measurement of political bias in LLMs remains a difficult problem.
Lunardi et al. [30], Rottger et al. [40] demonstrated that models’ political leanings are highly
unstable, shifting with subtle changes in phrasing or context, and questioned the reliability of
direct-questioning approaches. Complementing this, Santurkar et al. [42] asked whose opinions
LLMs actually encode, showing that models often blend viewpoints in ways that do not map neatly
onto any real-world demographic group. Together, these findings highlight the difficulty of pinning
down political orientation in LLMs, even as their outputs carry real-world implications.

The political and ethical dimensions of LLM behavior have also been examined from a broader
perspective. Li et al. [28] surveyed applications of LLMs in political science, framing how these
technologies intersect with political analysis. Similarly, Schramowski et al. [44] showed that pre-
trained language models encode human-like moral biases, implicitly learning judgments about
what is right or wrong from their training data and architecture. Such embedded value systems are
especially consequential when models are applied to politically sensitive tasks such as hate speech
detection.

In response, researchers have proposed a variety of methodologies to detect and mitigate bias.
Rekabsaz et al. [39] developed an adversarial framework for addressing societal biases in BERT-based
ranking, while Hube and Fetahu [21] introduced neural classifiers to detect biased statements in
text. More recently, Ng et al. [34] demonstrated that political biases in LLMs can skew performance
on stance classification tasks, producing uneven accuracy across viewpoints. Similarly, Lin et al.
[29] reported significant mismatches between automated bias detection and human perception,
suggesting that even mitigation-oriented systems may reproduce their own forms of bias.

Finally, several studies have turned explicitly to hate speech detection. Mozafari et al. [33]
proposed a transfer-learning approach using BERT, showing both its effectiveness on Twitter

datasets annotated for racism and sexism and the risk of reproducing racial bias during fine-
tuning. Guo et al. [17] further examined the use of LLMs for real-world hate speech detection,
noting their ability to capture contextual cues but also the difficulty of prompting them for bias-
sensitive classification. Collectively, these works underscore the central challenge: while bias
mitigation techniques can improve fairness, their effectiveness remains uneven across tasks, making
political bias a persistent obstacle for applying LLMs responsibly in hate speech detection. Whereas
prior research has centered on static biases embedded during pre-training, our study investigates
how dynamic, prompt-induced personas influence ideological consistency and fairness in content
moderation.

2.4 Model Scaling and Performance in Hate Speech Detection

As language models grow in size and complexity, their ability to understand context and capture
subtle patterns in language improves, offering clear benefits for hate speech detection. Larger
models demonstrate enhanced fluency, stronger generalization, and the capacity to detect nuanced
or context-dependent instances of harmful content [19, 24]. However, this increased sophistication
also introduces challenges: models can emulate complex human traits, including ideological biases,
which may influence moderation decisions and amplify risks in sensitive applications.

Recent work has explored strategies to mitigate these challenges. Guo et al. [17] examined GPT-
3.5-turbo in real-world hate speech detection, highlighting its ability to leverage contextual cues
while noting the lack of systematic guidance on effective prompting. Complementing this, Nirmal
et al. [35] investigated the use of LLM-generated rationales to improve interpretability, showing
that transparency can be enhanced without compromising detector performance. As models scale,
understanding both their capabilities and the associated risks—such as bias, misinformation, and
harmful content generation [51]—becomes increasingly critical for responsible deployment in hate
speech moderation.

Alongside scaling, advances in training methodology have also shaped model behavior. Kirk
et al. [26] reviewed the evolution of feedback learning approaches—most notably reinforcement
learning from human feedback (RLHF)—in aligning LLMs with subjective human values. While
such techniques improve alignment with user expectations, they also highlight ongoing difficulties
in faithfully representing diverse and sometimes conflicting value systems.

Finally, comparative evaluations reinforce both the promise and the limitations of scaling. Malik
et al. [31] found that transformer-based architectures consistently outperform traditional methods,
with larger models like RoBERTa achieving particularly strong F1 scores. Yet these gains come with
trade-offs: computational demands increase substantially, and risks of bias amplification persist,
as emphasized by Poletto et al. [37]. Together, these findings indicate that while larger models
enhance performance in hate speech detection, their deployment requires careful balancing of
efficiency, interpretability, and fairness.

3 METHODOLOGY

This study builds upon the experimental framework established by prior work [10] to investigate
whether persona-conditioned language models exhibit behavioral patterns in content moderation.
We (1) leverage the methodology introduced by Bernardelle et al. [3] to characterize the degree to
which models’ political orientations are steered by persona adoption; and (2) study how ideologically
polarized personas influence the model’s behavior in content moderation. Figure 1 provides a visual
summary of our methodology and experimental workflow.

Datasets

To assess how persona-conditioned models perform on content moderation, we rely on three
resources: two textual datasets and one multimodal dataset (see Table 1). These are:

Hate-Identity. Introduced by Yoder et al. [52], Hate-Identity contains 159,872 examples with
a binary classification scheme, comprising 47,968 hate speech instances and 111,904 non-hate
speech instances. The key distinguishing feature of Hate-Identity is its explicit categorization
of hate speech examples by the identity groups they target. The dataset includes hate speech
directed at various social groups including racial minorities (Black, Asian, Latinx), religious
communities (Muslim, Jewish, Christian), gender categories (Women, Men), sexual orientation
groups (LGBTQ+), and other identity-based groups (White). Of the total, 63,952 examples are
allocated to the test set, from which we randomly sample 10,000 statements for use in our
study.

Facebook Hateful Memes. Facebook Hateful Memes (FHM) [25] is a multi-modal bench-
mark introduced by Facebook AI that pairs images with text captions to evaluate hateful
content detection. It contains 10,000 memes labeled as hateful or non-hateful, along with addi-
tional fine-grained annotations for target groups and attack types’. The dataset is specifically
designed to test a model’s ability to detect hate that emerges from the interaction between
visual and textual modalities. To minimize potential data leakage, we omit the training split
from our experiments, as many LLMs are likely to have encountered it during pre-training.
Instead, we rely on the 500 unseen test samples provided in the fine-grained annotations,
which reduce to 458 after removing duplicates and further filtering to only include instances
with a single target group label.

Contextual Abuse Dataset. The Contextual Abuse Dataset (CAD)? [47] contains English-
language Reddit posts spanning several categories (e.g., Asian, Muslims, White, left-wing,
communist). For our study, we focus on the subset of politically targeted statements, all of
which are labeled as hateful. This subset consists of 688 samples, drawn from the original
27,494 entries in the dataset, and was accessed using the Subdata library [4].

3.2 Language Models

We selected six open-source, instruction-tuned language models for our study. Each model choice
is designed to capture both scaling effects and architectural differences, as well as enable direct
comparisons between models that share the same architecture but differ in modality (text vs. visual-
language). Our set includes three text-only models: Llama 3.1 (8B, 70B) and Qwen2.5 (32B). This
combination covers a broad parameter range and incorporates architectural diversity, allowing for
an analysis of scaling trends and comparisons between different scales within the same architecture.
To complement these, we included three multimodal models: Idefics3-8B-Llama3, Qwen2.5-VL-
7B-Instruct, and Qwen2.5-VL-32B-Instruct. These models allow us to assess how the addition of
visual inputs affects moderation behavior and, in the case of the Qwen2.5 models, enable direct
comparisons between the text-only and visual-language variants. We deliberately selected the
conversational variants of the models, which have been fine-tuned for instruction-following [36].
This aligns with our experimental approach, where in-context instructions are used to steer the
models adopting different personas to perform the PCT and subsequent content moderation.

3.3. Experimental Setup

As previously outlined in the introduction to this section, our study begins by examining how
prompting language models with different personas shapes their political alignment. We use the
PersonaHub’ dataset, which provides a diverse collection of natural language persona descrip-
tions. For each persona, we prompt each language model to complete the PCT’, a standardized
questionnaire that maps ideological views along two axes: economic (left-right) and social (author-
itarian—libertarian). For each persona, we obtain a two-dimensional point that characterizes the
model’s political stance when conditioned on that persona. We apply this procedure across our
six language models, generating model-specific distributions of political perspectives. These are
visualized using hexbin density plots. From the compass distributions, we then select 400 “extreme”
personas per model using two complementary strategies:

e Corner selection. We select 100 personas from each of the four compass quadrants (top-left,
top-right, bottom-left, bottom-right), chosen to maximize both ideological extremity and
internal consistency.

e Economic-axis selection. We select 200 personas from the far economic left and 200 from
the far right, enabling us to isolate the effect of economic polarization.

By choosing ideologically extreme personas, we maximize contrast between ideological positions
and can more clearly observe whether models exhibit consistent and systematic patterns when
pushed to the boundaries of the political spectrum. Figure 2 shows the resulting political compass
distributions with extreme personas highlighted within the distributions. Further details on persona
selection implementation can be found in Appendix A.

Building on this, we further extend the methodology to address our central research question:
whether differences in political orientation obtained trough persona conditioning affects a model’s
behavior in harmful content classification. Each selected persona is used to prompt the same
language models to classify a fixed set of harmful content examples. Since all personas receive
identical input samples, we can systematically evaluate how ideological positioning influences
moderation behavior. Prompt formats and templates used in this setup are detailed in Appendix B.

We structure our study as four investigations: (1) measuring baseline moderation performance
across models; (2) testing how sensitivity to harmful content varies with ideological framings; (3)
examining agreement patterns within and across ideologies; and (4) evaluating partisan asymmetries
in political hate speech moderation. This progression moves from general capability assessment to
detailed analysis of ideological bias.

Models’ Overall Moderation Capabilities. As a preliminary step, we assess the models’ ability
to perform the content moderation task by measuring accuracy and F1. To provide a meaningful
point of comparison, we establish a baseline evaluation using standard prompts without any
persona conditioning. This baseline reflects each model’s moderation ability in a neutral setting,
free from potential confounds such as added prompt length or contextual framing. We then measure
performance when personas are introduced, averaging scores across all personas and ideological

positions. Comparing these results to the baseline allows us to determine whether persona adoption
systematically influences moderation outcomes. All evaluations are conducted on the test sets of
the respective datasets, ensuring that reported numbers reflect genuine generalisation rather than
memorisation.

Detection Sensitivity to Generic Harmful Content. Beyond overall moderation capabilities,
we also examine classification behavior separately for personas located at each extreme of the
political compass. For each position-model-dataset combination, we compute standard headline
metrics—accuracy, precision, recall, and F1—to capture different dimensions of classification quality.

In addition to these ground-truth—based measures, we also track the detection rate: the pro-
portion of inputs labeled as harmful regardless of whether that label is correct. This provides a
complementary view of how readily different personas lead models to assign the harmful label.

Agreement Patterns by Ideology. While aggregate metrics provide a first indication of modera-
tion capability, they obscure the more nuanced ways in which persona conditioning can influence
model behavior. To move beyond surface-level metrics, we analyze the extent to which personas
converge or diverge in their judgments, focusing on patterns of agreement between ideological
positions. By comparing intra-ideology agreement (personas within the same political quadrant)
and inter-ideology agreement (personas across opposing quadrants), we assess whether shared
ideological framing leads to more consistent moderation outcomes. Agreement is quantified using
both Cohen’s x and Gwet’s AC1, which provide complementary measures of inter-rater reliability
in the presence of imbalanced class distributions. To determine whether observed differences reflect
systematic effects rather than random variation, we apply Mann-Whitney U tests, complemented
with Cohen’s d effect sizes to gauge the strength of ideological cohesion. More details can be found
in Appendix C

Additionally, we consider how agreement patterns scale with model size and vary across text-only
and multimodal settings, thereby testing whether ideological alignment is amplified in larger or
more capable models, and whether it manifests differently when harmfulness judgments involve
visual as well as textual cues.

Finally, to ensure that observed differences in agreement are not simply driven by globally high
consensus (e.g., from a large proportion of unambiguous items), we restrict further analysis to
disputed samples—cases where at least one persona’s label differs from the others. By focusing
only on such disagreements, we can examine whether ideological alignment predicts convergence
or divergence specifically in borderline cases, where persona-driven differences are most likely to
surface.

As a transition to the next stage of our analysis, we then test whether this observed ideological
cohesion extends into politically sensitive contexts.

Partisan Bias in Political Hate Speech. Finally, we investigate persona behavior when mod-
erating political hate speech—that is, content targeting groups such as communists, democrats,
conservatives, or republicans. We test whether personas from the left and right of the political com-
pass behave differently depending on which category is being targeted by hate speech. Detection
rates are computed separately for the two persona positions and disaggregated by the political
target group. Since in this setting all statements are labeled as hate speech, detection rates in this
analysis coincide with both recall and accuracy, providing a straightforward measure of the models’
sensitivity.

To quantify the extent and direction of partisan asymmetries, we report Odds Ratios (OR) between
left- and right-aligned personas, with values greater than one indicating a relative increase in
detection for left personas and values less than one indicating the opposite. This allows us to assess

not only whether asymmetries exist, but also the degree to which detection sensitivity shifts across
political target groups. In addition, our analysis considers whether persona adoption systematically
alters the models’ threshold for labeling political content as hate speech, and whether larger models
exhibit qualitatively different patterns than smaller ones.

3.4 Computational Resources and Reproducibility

All experiments were conducted on the High-Performance Computing (HPC) facility at The Univer-
sity of Queensland, using NVIDIA H100 GPUs. Resource allocation was tailored to the computational
demands of each language model. Models in the 7-8B parameter range and 32B parameters were
run on a single H100 GPU, while 70B models utilized two H100 GPUs. For the political alignment
experiments, which involved generating political compass distributions, execution times ranged
from approximately 6 hours for smaller models to up to 38 hours for larger ones, with a cumulative
compute time of roughly 110 hours across all six models. For the hateful content classification
tasks, runtimes varied according to dataset size. The CAD and MULTIOff datasets (~600 samples ~
400 personas) required about 25 minutes for smaller models and up to 2 hours for larger models.
The Hate-Identity dataset (~10,000 samples x 400 personas) demanded around 25 hours for smaller
models and up to 124 hours for larger ones. Finally, the Facebook Hateful Memes dataset required
approximately 1.5 hours on smaller models and 22 hours on the largest models.

To facilitate reproducibility, all code, prompts and configuration files for running the experiments
are available in our GitHub repository?.

4 RESULTS

Building on the methodology introduced in Section 3, we begin by assessing the extent to which
persona adoption shifts the political alignment of language models. Figure 2 illustrates that persona
adoption induces systematic ideological variation, shifting a model’s expressed alignment across
wide portions of the political compass depending on the assigned persona and model scale. These
findings extend prior work [2] by confirming that conditioning not only shapes language models’
stated positions but does so in a consistent and predictable manner.

Building on this observation, we turn to our central research question: does this induced political
alignment translate into tangible differences in model behavior on a functional task like content
moderation? To answer this, we proceed by first establishing the overall moderation capabilities of
the models, then dissecting how different ideological personas alter detection patterns, and finally
probing whether these behavioral shifts culminate in demonstrable partisan bias when moderating
politically charged content.

4.1 Models’ Overall Moderation Capabilities

First, we establish whether the selected models are competent at harmful content classification.
Table 2 reports aggregate performance for both baseline prompting (no persona conditioning) and
persona-conditioned setups, with scores averaged across all persona positions.

Overall, the results demonstrate that all models achieve reasonable performance on their respec-
tive tasks. In the text-only setting, large-scale models such as Qwen2.5-32B and Llama-3.1-70B yield
accuracy values around 0.78—-0.81. Similarly, vision—language models such as Qwen2.5-VL-32B
show competitive accuracy (0.71 on the Facebook benchmark), while smaller multimodal variants
achieve lower but still robust scores. These numbers indicate that the chosen architectures are well
within the expected performance range for content moderation tasks [12, 32], confirming their
suitability for further analysis.

A second key observation is that persona prompting has little to no effect on headline performance.
When aggregating across all personas, models exhibit nearly identical accuracy and F1 scores
compared to their baseline counterparts. For example, Qwen2.5-32B shows a marginal accuracy
increase in the text-only hate speech detection task (0.808 — 0.813), while the multimodal Qwenz2.5-
VL-32B records only a minor decrease (0.721 — 0.710). Similar negligible shifts are observed across
the board, with no systematic trend toward improvement or degradation. This finding suggests
that the additional context introduced by personas does not significantly impair a model’s ability
to recognize harmful content.

4.2 Detection Sensitivity to Generic Harmful Content

Table 2 shows that overall accuracy remains remarkably stable with the addition of personas, both
in text-only and vision-language tasks. However, as Table 3 shows, examining performance by
ideological group reveals subtle yet consistent behavioral differences.

First, the trade-off between precision and recall varies systematically with persona position. In
most settings, personas from the top right quadrant achieve the highest precision, and low recall
reflecting a more conservative labeling style—reluctant to assign the “harmful” tag unless evidence
is strong. In contrast, personas from the bottom left quadrant almost always record the highest or
second-highest recall, indicating a greater tendency to flag content as harmful, even at the cost of
false positives. Meanwhile, personas in the bottom right quadrant frequently deliver the strongest
accuracy and F1 scores, reflecting a balanced compromise between caution and sensitivity. These
results suggest that persona-induced biases manifest in how aggressively or conservatively a model
applies the “harmful” label.

To probe this hypothesis more directly, we turn to detection rates (Table 4), which measure the
raw proportion of samples labeled as hate speech irrespective of ground truth. Here we observe

that “bottom” personas—especially those on the bottom left—are consistently more “trigger-happy,’
labeling a higher fraction of content as harmful compared to their “top” counterparts. While the
absolute differences are modest, often within a few percentage points, their consistency across
models and modalities is striking.

Taken together, these findings highlight that persona conditioning subtly alters models’ sensitivity
to harmful content in structured and repeatable ways. This raises the question of whether these
subtle but consistent detection differences remain isolated to individual personas, or whether they
reflect broader patterns of ideological alignment across groups of personas.

4.3 Agreement Patterns by Ideology

While the previous section established that personas alter a model’s detection sensitivity beneath the
surface of stable aggregate metrics, we now investigate whether these individual biases consolidate
into coherent ideological clusters.

Our initial analysis of agreement scores (Table 5) reveals asymmetric behaviors. Although
overall agreement is mostly high, personas from the same ideological quadrant generally agree
more with each other than with personas from opposing quadrants. This demonstrates that intra-
ideology agreement is systematically higher than inter-ideology agreement, even when the absolute
differences are modest.

This pattern can be observed in Table 6, which compares average intra- versus inter-ideology
agreement using Cohen’s x and Gwet’s AC1. Across all models and datasets, the difference is
statistically significant (p < 0.001), confirming that shared ideology yields measurably higher
coherence. Crucially, the effect size (Cohen’s d) scales with model size: smaller models show modest
yet consistent pattern, while larger models (e.g., Llama-3.1-70B) exhibit substantially stronger
ideological cohesion. This scaling effect indicates that as models become more capable at persona
adoption, they also encode ideological “in-groups” more distinctly.

The proportion of items with at least one disagreement provides further evidence of this dynamic.
Larger models show more such cases, suggesting that while they handle clear-cut examples consis-
tently, they diverge more sharply on borderline cases. To ensure that these effects are not simply
a byproduct of globally high consensus, we repeated the analysis restricted to disputed samples

dataset) and vision-language models (on FHM dataset). Each cell reports the agreement score between two
groups of extreme personas when labeling harmful content (TL = Top-Left, TR = Top-Right, BL = Bottom-Left,

inter-position overlap. Bold values indicate the highest agreement for each model, while underlined values

only (cases with at least one persona disagreement). As expected, absolute agreement scores are
somewhat lower in this subset, but the relative asymmetry between intra- and inter-ideology
agreement remains robust (see Appendix C.2 for full results).

This in-group cohesion extends across both text and multimodal models, though absolute agree-
ment levels are lower in the vision setting. For example, Qwen2.5-VL-7B shows markedly reduced
inter-rater reliability compared to text-only counterparts, likely due to the greater ambiguity of
harmful meme classification or the relative instability of current vision language model (VLM)
architectures. Still, the ideological structuring remains intact across modalities, with intra-ideology
agreement consistently outpacing inter-ideology agreement.

Together, these findings highlight that persona conditioning produces more than random noise:
it generates coherent ideological clusters whose cohesion strengthens with model scale. Personas
from the same quadrant consistently “think alike” particularly on contested cases, while personas
across opposing quadrants diverge.

To directly test whether this ideological cohesion translates into partisan bias when evaluating
politically charged content, we next analyze hate speech detection targeted at specific political
groups.

4.4 Partisan Bias in Political Hate Speech

Table 7 reports detection rates disaggregated by political target group and persona position. The
results for Llama-3.1-8B illustrate a straightforward asymmetry: left-aligned personas consistently
classify a higher proportion of content as hate speech than right-aligned personas, regardless of
which political group is being targeted. This broad shift in labeling threshold mirrors the pattern
observed in Table 4, where left personas display a generally lower tolerance for potentially harmful
material. Odds Ratios (OR) for this model are uniformly greater than 1, confirming a systematic
bias toward higher detection sensitivity when adopting a left-leaning persona.

By contrast, the larger models reveal a more complex pattern. Both Qwen2.5-32B and Llama-
3.1-70B exhibit a form of defensive bias: left personas show heightened sensitivity to anti-left hate
speech (OR > 1), while right personas display the reverse, becoming more sensitive to anti-right
hate speech (OR < 1). This reversal suggests that ideological alignment not only shifts detection
thresholds globally, but also conditions the model to prioritize protection of its “in-group” while
downplaying harmfulness directed at opposing groups. Notably, the strength of this effect appears
to scale with model size, albeit confounded by cross-architecture differences that limit direct
comparisons. Llama-3.1-70B, in particular, shows the clearest divergence, with large OR differences
emphasizing its partisan reactivity compared to the smaller models.

Taken together, these findings demonstrate that persona conditioning induces marked partisan
asymmetries in hate speech moderation. Smaller models (e.g., Llama-3.1-8B) primarily reflect a global
sensitivity shift along the political spectrum, whereas larger models exhibit more nuanced—and
arguably more concerning—ideological defensiveness.

5 DISCUSSION

The findings of this study show that persona conditioning does not undermine models’ baseline
competence in harmful content classification, but it does introduce subtle and systematic shifts
in behavior (RQ1). Rather than changing overall accuracy, personas primarily alter the balance
of precision and recall in ways aligned with ideological leanings. Left-leaning personas are more
likely to label content as harmful, while right-leaning personas adopt more conservative thresholds
(RQ2). These differences are not random but emerge consistently across models, suggesting that
persona adoption shapes the decision-making of LLMs in structured ways.

Beyond individual variation, we observe that personas cluster ideologically, with models ex-
hibiting higher agreement within ideological quadrants than across them (RQ3). This intra-group
cohesion grows stronger with model scale, showing that larger models more distinctly internalize
ideological framings rather than smoothing them out. When applied to politically charged modera-
tion, these tendencies translate into partisan asymmetries. Smaller models primarily reflect global

Ideology-Based LLMs for Content Moderation                                                                                  17

sensitivity shifts, but larger models adopt a more nuanced defensive bias, prioritizing the protection
of their ideological in-group while downplaying harm directed at opponents (RQ2, RQ3, RQ4).

Overall, text-only models produce clearer ideological structuring, while vision-language models
show lower agreement and greater instability, likely due to the challenges of harmful meme
classification. Still, the same ideological patterns appear across modalities, underscoring that
persona conditioning has a robust and generalizable influence (RQ4).

6 CONCLUSION

This study examined how persona-based conditioning influences the fairness and consistency
of LLMs in content moderation. While prior work has demonstrated that personas can shift the
political stance expressed by LLMs—often measured through instruments such as the Political
Compass Test [2]—little attention has been given to how these shifts translate into downstream
moderation tasks. Our work addresses this gap by analyzing the interaction between persona
conditioning, model architecture, and modality (text-only vs. multimodal inputs).

We began by mapping a diverse set of synthetic personas onto a two-dimensional ideological
space using the PCT for six different LLMs. From this mapping, we selected ideologically “extreme”
personas and evaluated their behavior on both general and politically targeted harmful content
classification tasks. This controlled experimental design allowed us to isolate and measure the
influence of persona-induced alignment on moderation outcomes.

At the level of headline metrics, persona conditioning appeared to have little effect. However,
deeper analysis revealed systematic behavioral shifts. Personas with different ideological leanings
showed distinct sensitivities, with some being consistently more likely to label content as harmful.
More critically, agreement analyses revealed that models—especially larger ones—exhibited strong
ideological cohesion: personas from the same political quadrant aligned closely with one another,
while diverging significantly from those in opposing quadrants. This ideological alignment intensi-
fied with model scale. On politically targeted tasks, these effects manifested as partisan bias, where
models were judging more harshly harmful content directed at their ideological “in-group” while
being more lenient toward content aimed at their opponents.

These findings suggest that persona prompting is not a neutral interface for customization but a
powerful vector for introducing and amplifying ideological biases. In content moderation systems,
this dynamic raises the risk that AI models may inadvertently reinforce partisan viewpoints while
presenting themselves as neutral arbiters. As models become larger and more capable, the strength
of these biases may only grow, posing challenges for fairness, trust, and transparency in moderation
platforms.

To ensure careful interpretation of our results, we would like to acknowledge some limitations
that may affect their generalizability. The use of synthetic personas from PersonaHub may not
fully capture the complexity of real-world identities and ideological nuance. We mitigate this
concern by shifting our analysis toward the overall distribution of political leanings rather than
focusing on specific persona descriptions. Second, the PCT offers only a simplified, two-dimensional
representation of political beliefs and is rooted in a Western political framework, which may not
generalize globally. Third, our experiments are restricted to a limited set of open-source models,
and the observed behaviors may not extend to other architectures or proprietary systems. Finally,
our evaluation tasks, while controlled, do not encompass the full complexity or adversarial nature
of real-world content moderation.

These limitations point to promising directions for future research. Expanding this analysis
to include a wider range of models—particularly those with extensive safety fine-tuning—would
help clarify whether such training mitigates persona-driven bias. Exploring richer and more
multidimensional models of ideology, or designing personas derived from real-world data, could

yield more realistic insights. Perhaps most importantly, future work should develop robust methods
to detect and counteract persona-induced bias.

Ultimately, our findings highlight that ensuring fairness and impartiality in Al-powered mod-
eration requires more than simply monitoring baseline performance metrics. It demands careful
attention to the subtle ways in which LLMs interpret and embody the identities we assign them,
and the ideological biases that can emerge as a result.

A PERSONA SELECTION METHODOLOGY

Our persona selection process aimed to identify individuals with well-defined political positions
while maintaining representation across the political spectrum. We developed a systematic scoring
approach that favors personas with both extreme and clearly aligned ideological stances within
their respective quadrants.

A.1 Selection Criteria and Metrics

For each persona p with coordinates (x, y) on the Political Compass Test, we computed the following
metrics:

A.1.1_ Extremity Score. We quantified the extremity of a persona’s political position using their
Euclidean distance from the origin:

Lip) = ee

Ideology-Based LLMs for Content Moderation                                                                                  21

This metric favors personas with strong political convictions, as indicated by their distance from
centrist positions.

A.1.2_ Quadrant Alignment Score. To ensure selected personas clearly represent their quadrant’s
ideology, we calculated their alignment with the quadrant’s diagonal axis. The alignment score
A(p) is computed differently for each quadrant pair:

e Top-right (TR) and bottom-left (BL) quadrants:
ly — x!
v2

Artrpi(p) =

e Top-left (TL) and bottom-right (BR) quadrants:
ly +x!

v2

This measure represents the perpendicular distance from the persona’s position to their quad-

AtLBR(p) =

rant’s principal diagonal, normalized by V2 to maintain consistency with the extremity score
scale.

A.1.3. Composite Selection Score for Quadrant Personas. To select personas representing each of
the four quadrants, we combined extremity and alignment scores into a final selection score S(p):

S(p) = (1- w) -Eq(p) + w- (1 Aq(p))
Where:
e Ey (p) is the extremity score normalized within quadrant q

e Aq (p) is the alignment score normalized within quadrant q
e w is the diagonal weight parameter (set to 0.4)

Normalization is performed separately within each quadrant gq:

f                 E(p)             ;                 A(p)
E,(p) = ——P A, (p) = —“"
MaXpeP, E(p)            MaXpeP, A(p)
Here, P, represents the set of all personas in quadrant q. This ensures fair comparison of personas
within each ideological region.

A.1.4_ Economic Extremes (All-Left / All-Right). In addition to the quadrant personas, we identified
economic extremes, representing maximal divergence along the economic axis regardless of social
orientation. For each persona p, we computed an economic extremity score:

E.(p) = |x|
Personas with the highest E.(p) on the left and right halves of the compass were selected as
the all-left and all-right economic extremes. The composite selection score S(p) is not used for
economic extremes.

A.2 Selection Process
From the distributions of personas on the Political Compass, we employed a two different strategies
to select a total of 400 “extreme” personas per model:

(1) Corner Selection: For each of the four compass quadrants (top-left, top-right, bottom-
left, bottom-right), we computed the composite score S(p) for all personas in the quadrant,
combining extremity and alignment metrics. Personas were then ranked by S(p), and the top
100 personas per quadrant were selected. This approach ensures that the selected personas

exhibit both strong ideological positions and clear alignment with their quadrant, yielding a
total of 400 “corner” personas.

(2) Economic-Axis Selection: To capture extreme economic positions independently of social
ideology, we computed the economic extremity score E.(p) = |x| for all personas. From
this ranking, we selected the 200 most extreme left-wing and 200 most extreme right-wing
personas. This provides a total of 400 “economic-axis” personas, allowing us to isolate the
effects of economic polarization.

B PERSONAS AND PROMPT TEMPLATES

This appendix details the prompt templates used in both phases of our experimental design. Each
template is designed to elicit a specific behavior from the language models, either for measuring
political orientation or for classifying harmful content.

B.1_ Political Compass Elicitation

We measure the political orientation of various personas by prompting each language model to
complete the Political Compass Test. Following the methodology of Bernardelle et al. [3], we use a
constrained prompt to ensure clear and analyzable responses. For each of the 62 statements in the
PCT, and for every persona in the PersonaHub dataset, we query the models using the following
template.

Prompt for Political Compass Test Elicitation

Your task is to evaluate a statement and provide a response based on specific conditions. Answer with
"AGREE’ or STRONGLY AGREE’ if the conditions favor agreement, and DISAGREE’ or STRONGLY
DISAGREE’ if they favor disagreement. Provide only the output ’Strongly agree’, Agree’, Disagree’
or Strongly disagree’ without additional commentary.

Statement: [STATEMENT]
Respond taking on the perspective of the following persona: [PERSONA]
Output:

This format restricts the model’s output to one of four choices, which allows for the direct
mapping of persona-conditioned responses to the numerical scores required to plot coordinates on
the political compass.

B.2. Harmful Content Classification

Once extreme personas are selected, we evaluate how a persona’s political orientation affects its
behavior in downstream content moderation tasks. The prompts here are designed to instruct
models to adopt a selected persona and classify harmful content from different datasets.

We use a different prompt tailored for each dataset in our study.

B.2.1_ General Content Moderation (Corner-Based Personas). For general hate speech classification,
we used personas from the four corners of the political compass. The prompts below were applied
to the Hate-Identity and Facebook Hateful Memes datasets.

C.1 Agreement Analysis

To quantify consistency in harmfulness judgments across personas, we compute pairwise agreement
scores for all persona pairs within each model. For every pair of personas, agreement is evaluated
on the full set of items, and scores are then averaged to produce two aggregated measures: (i)
intra-quadrant agreement, capturing alignment among personas situated in the same ideological
quadrant, and (ii) inter-quadrant agreement, capturing alignment across quadrants.

Agreement is computed using two chance-corrected reliability coefficients: Cohen’s x and Gwet’s
AC1. Both adjust raw agreement for chance alignment but differ in how they estimate the “expected
by chance” component, which makes AC1 more robust when label distributions are skewed (e.g.,
most items being judged as non-harmful).

Formally, let p> denote the observed proportion of agreement, and p, the expected agreement by
chance. Then Cohen’s x is defined as:

Po ~ Pe
1 pe’
where po = W x ety? = y\”} is the proportion of exact matches between two raters, and
Pe is computed from the empirical marginal probabilities of each category. Under strong class
imbalance, this calculation can yield counterintuitive values (e.g., low x despite high raw agreement).
Gwet’s AC1 modifies the estimation of chance agreement by smoothing the marginal probabilities,
reducing the impact of imbalance. Specifically,

k=

where

K                        1
Pe = )) me (1 =m),   me =) Vik
k=1                           i=1

and yj is an indicator for whether item i was labeled into category k. Unlike x, p} does not
inflate when one category dominates, making AC1 less sensitive to prevalence effects.

For each model, we summarize the pairwise coefficients by computing average intra- and inter-
quadrant agreement. To test whether intra-quadrant agreement systematically exceeds inter-
quadrant agreement, we apply the Mann-Whitney U test. Beyond significance, we report Cohen’s
d to express the standardized magnitude of these differences.

All agreement analyses are conducted separately by model and dataset.

Table 8. Agreement matrices for persona-based political compass positions across text-only (on Hate-Identity
dataset) and vision-language models (on FHM dataset). Each cell reports the agreement score between two
groups of extreme personas when labeling harmful content (TL = Top-Left, TR = Top-Right, BL = Bottom-Left,
BR = Bottom-Right). Diagonal values capture intra-position consistency, while off-diagonal values measure
inter-position overlap. This table presents agreement values considering only samples that have at least one

disagreement between personas. Three agreement metrics are shown: Raw Agreement, Cohen’s Kappa, and
Gwet’s AC1.

Table 10. Agreement matrices for persona-based political compass positions on text-only language models
on the CAD dataset. Each cell reports the agreement score between two groups of extreme personas when
labeling harmful content (Left and Right). Diagonal values capture intra-position consistency, while off-
diagonal values measure inter-position overlap. Three agreement metrics are shown: Raw Agreement, Cohen’s
Kappa, and Gwet’s AC1.

Table 11. Average (+ standard deviation) agreement scores derived from the ideology agreement matrices.
“Intra” values correspond to agreements between personas within the same ideological quadrant (matrix
diagonal), while “Inter” values capture agreements across different quadrants (off-diagonal). Results are
reported for both Cohen’s x and Gwet’s AC1, alongside statistical tests (p-values, Cohen’s d) comparing
intra- versus inter-ideology agreement. The final column indicates the proportion of items with at least one
persona disagreement. This table presents averaged values considering only samples that have at least one
disagreement between personas.
