Abstract

The development of AI for mental health is
hindered by a lack of authentic therapy dia-
logues, due to strict privacy regulations and
the fact that clinical sessions were historically
rarely recorded. We present an LLM-driven
pipeline that generates synthetic counseling di-
alogues based on structured client profiles and
psychological questionnaires. Grounded on
the principles of Cognitive Behavioral Ther-
apy (CBT), our method creates synthetic ther-
apeutic conversations for clinical disorders
such as anxiety and depression. Our frame-
work, SQPsych (Structured Questionnaire-
based Psychotherapy), converts structured psy-
chological input into natural language dia-
logues through therapist-client simulations.
Due to data governance policies and privacy
restrictions prohibiting the transmission of clin-
ical questionnaire data to third-party services,
previous methodologies relying on proprietary
models are infeasible in our setting. We address
this limitation by generating a high-quality
corpus using open-weight LLMs, validated
through human expert evaluation and LLM-
based assessments. Our SQPsychLLM mod-
els fine-tuned on SQPsychConv achieve strong
performance on counseling benchmarks, sur-
passing baselines in key therapeutic skills. Our
findings highlight the potential of synthetic data
to enable scalable, data-secure, and clinically
informed AI for mental health support. We
will release our code, models, and corpus at

1 Introduction

Acquiring therapy-client dialogues from clinical in-
stitutions is difficult due to strict privacy laws such
as HIPAA (US), GDPR (EU) and PIPL (China),
along with ethical issues regarding patient confi-
dentiality (De Freitas et al., 2022). These restrict ac-
cess to large and varied datasets necessary to build

AI systems for mental health care. Furthermore,
clinical psychology interviews and counseling ses-
sions from the past were not routinely recorded or
transcribed. The questionnaires in practice were
often derived from informally distilled insights dur-
ing these sessions. With LLM, there is now po-
tential to reuse these processes and data sources to
synthetically generate more structured and mean-
ingful outcomes, such as therapy-client dialogues.

Synthetic therapy-client conversations offer valu-
able opportunities in mental health care and clinical
research (Sharma et al., 2021). They can also power
AI tools for screening, and diagnostic support, help-
ing to streamline the intake process and reduce pres-
sure on already overburdened therapists (Cabrera
et al., 2023). In addition, simulated therapy ses-
sions can serve as a training tool for students and
early career mental health and social workers, pro-
viding hands-on experience in a controlled, ethical
environment (Fu et al., 2023).

We introduce an LLM-based generation pipeline
that produces synthetic counseling dialogues con-

ditioned on structured client data and standardized
mental health assessments, and psychologically in-
formed guidance. These conversations are tailored
to mental health conditions (e.g., major depressive
disorder and anxiety). By integrating expertise
and best practice in psychology (Cognitive Behav-
ior Therapy - CBT) (Beck, 1963), the resulting
data can serve as a valuable resource to improve
fine-tuning therapeutic agents, intervention plan-
ning. By bridging structured psychological data
and natural language conversation, our approach
contributes to scalable and clinically relevant con-
versation generation. Figure 1 demonstrates our
main concept. Our contributions span modeling,
data, and evaluation:

therapist and client personas, enabling generation
of counseling conversations.
¢ Data & Model Resources - Synthetic Corpus
& Fine-tuned Models: We use seven open mod-
els (23B—123B) for local synthetic data genera-
tion, conditioned on real-world structured client
information and questionnaires. This choice en-
sures sensitive questionnaires are not shared with
proprietary models. We then leverage the syn-
thetically generated dataset, distilled from larger
LLMs, to fine-tune seven smaller models, en-
abling resource efficiency and practical utility.
Evaluation & Insight - Benchmarking & Ex-
pert Feedback: We perform a holistic evalua-
tion with human experts and automatic metrics.
(1) Our models perform effectively on two spe-
cialized counseling skill benchmarks, exceeding
baseline models in key therapeutic competencies
such as distortion and core beliefs’ identifica-
tion. (2) In preference evaluations conducted
by both an LLMs panel and human experts, our
fine-tuned model consistently outperforms the
baselines. (3) Expert feedback offers valuable in-
sights for enhancing future data/models focused
on counseling tasks.

2 Methods

We propose SQPsych, a pipeline converting struc-
tured data to conversations which synthesizes clin-
ically therapist-client dialogues by conditioning
on structured mental health data. This pipeline

integrates standardized client metadata and ques-
tionnaire, combined with targeted role-based gener-
ation strategies informed by clinical expertise. We
describe the most important aspect of our pipeline
in this section. Detailed information on the genera-
tion workflow can be found in the Appendix B.

2.1 Structured Data Conditioning &
Conversion

Our pipeline is conditioned on structured informa-
tion: general client information (e.g., age, gen-
der, etc.) and standardized questionnaire results
(e.g., PHQ-9, BDI, etc.). Since much of this data
is available in numerical or categorical form, we
convert it to natural language for proper descrip-
tions. This conversion may help the model interpret
client characteristics and psychological states with
more precision. We construct a hash map that maps
numerical values to their corresponding natural lan-
guage descriptions for this purpose. Figure 2 shows
an example of the formatting of our data input.

2.2 Dual-role Generation Strategy

Previous approaches, such as CACTUS (Lee et al.,
2024) and SMILE (Qiu et al., 2024), generate con-
versations using a single model that simulates both
roles simultaneously. In contrast, we employ a
dual-agent framework where separate models in-
dependently simulate the therapist and client, each
operating with distinct reasoning processes and in-
formation access patterns. This approach enables
dialogue dynamics, as each agent maintains its own
perspective and responds based on role-specific
knowledge and objectives.

Specifically, the client agent is conditioned on
background information and questionnaire data to


===== PAGE BREAK =====

generate responses that reflect the client’s psycho-
logical state and personal circumstances. The thera-
pist agent operates with therapeutic guidelines and
intervention strategies, responding to the client’s
statements. For that in the generated dialogue, the
LLM therapist will apply CBT skills (e.g., para-
Dhrasing, validation), while the LLM client will
express emotions and hesitation, grounded in per-
sonal data and questionnaire-derived.

2.3 Turn-Based Generation Workflow

The conversation proceeds in a role-playing ther-
apeutic simulation.The workflow includes the fol-
lowing steps: 1. Initialization. We initialize two
language models, one for the role of the therapist
and the other for the client. 2. Turn-by-turn in-
teraction. The interaction proceeds turn-by-turn:
the therapist model generates an initial utterance,
which is then passed to the client model to produce
a response. This exchange continues iteratively,
and both models incorporate the full conversation
history at each step to maintain contextual consis-
tency. 3. Termination criterion. The dialogue pro-
gresses until the therapist model issues an explicit
signal with an time acknowledgment [/END] token
to end the session. To ensure sufficient conversa-
tional depth, a minimum of 15 turns is required be-
fore termination is permitted. 4. Post-processing.
After generation, we conduct a post-processing step
with regex to remove redundant utterances or un-
necessary explanations.

3 Experiments

Dataset & Structured Input We use the ques-
tionnaire and data from client information collected
by Kircher et al. (2019), which is publicly available
on demand. The questionnaire corpus consists of
2090 clients, differentiated by control and MDD
(major depressive disorder) status. The primary dis-
tinction between the control group and the MDD
group lies in their foundational beliefs. Cogni-
tive challenges in MDD clients persist longer than
those in control group clients. Subsequently, we
separated them into training, development, and test
sets to create the respective conversations. Table 3
shows the split of the questionnaire dataset.

We incorporate general client information includ-
ing demographic attributes: age, gender, education,
and employment, along with family information
such as genetic risk, parent education, and number
of children. clinical values related to MDD such as

age of onset, duration of episode are also included.
We specifically select questionnaire results from
MDD-related assessment tools such as the Hamil-
ton Depression Rating Scale (HAM-D) (Hamil-
ton, 1980), Hamilton Anxiety Rating Scale (HAM-
A) (Hamilton, 1959), and Beck Depression Inven-
tory (BDI) (Beck, 1974). Since the questionnaire
data sets are in table form, we convert them to nat-
ural language with a clear description. We refer to
Appendix B.2 for an example of conversion.

3.1 Synthetic Datasets Generation

Although the clinical questionnaire dataset from
Kircher et al. (2019) is anonymized, the sensitiv-
ity of the data and its access terms trigger strict
requirements. Specifically, data privacy regula-
tions restrict the use of clinical questionnaire data
to controlled, audited environments. This con-
straint prohibits the transmission of the data to
third party services such as OpenAI. Consequently,
we are limited to employing open models, and
must ensure that each of the seven models used
in this study is hosted locally to guarantee full
data protection and regulatory compliance. Ta-
ble 1 lists the seven open models used. We use
vLLM (Kwon et al., 2023) to host these models
locally and send a request to each LLM. These

models run on four A100 GPUs, each with 80GB
of VRAM, using the BF16 configuration. We call
our synthetic generated data set SQPsychConv, for
example, SQPsychConv,,i<¢ra) 18 the dataset gener-
ated by the mistral model. Table 2 shows the
statistics of the data set in terms of the number of
utterances, average turns per dialogue, and aver-
age number of tokens per utterance. Generating a
typical 15-turn conversation requires roughly three
minutes. We obtain 2090 conversations per model.

Baselines Models Further on, we compare our
fine-tuned SQPsychLLM models (Sec. 3.1) with
previous works. We aim to assess the trans-
fer of counseling skills from our open-weight
model conditioned on questionnaires to smaller
models versus baselines transferring using real
data and proprietary models. As a baseline, we
choose models that are designed for counseling,
such as CAMEL (Lee et al., 2024), Psych8k (Liu
et al., 2023) and mental health applications such
as MentaLLaMA (Yang et al., 2024) which is
the first open source LLM instruction specifically
built on top of Llama-2-7b-chat-hf (Touvron
et al., 2023) to detect mental health signals in
the text of social networks and explain its rea-
soning. Secondly, we use CAMELwhich is based
on Llama3-8B-Instruct. CAMEL is trained on
CACTUS (Lee et al., 2024) data, which is a multi-
turn synthetic dialogue dataset crafted with a CBT
structure using gpt-4o to mimic realistic counsel-
ing sessions. Finally, since the real-world dataset
Psych8k (rewritten by gpt-4) is available in a fine-
tuned instruction format, we perform a complete
BF16 fine-tuning on LLama3-8B-Instruct with
the same hyperparameters as CAMEL.

Model Finetuning After finishing the gen-
eration of our synthetic conversation dataset,
we fine-tune LLama3-8B-Instruct (Grattafiori
et al., 2024) on each portion of the syn-
thetic dataset to simplify comparison with base-
line models. Concretely, we call, for exam-

ple, that SQPsychLLM,,;.,,,, 18 fine-tuned on
LLama3-8B-Instruct with SQPsychConv™st"@!
synthetic dataset. We use similar hyperparameter
as CAMEL for fine-tuning.

3.2 Expert Evaluation

For expert evaluation, our main goal is to assess the
counseling skills of LLM therapists. We engage
three professional therapists with graduate degrees
in psychology: one focuses on qualitative analy-
sis, offering insights based on clinical experience,
while two experts conduct quantitative evaluations
following established guidelines. Together, they
provide a comprehensive assessment of the coun-
seling abilities of LLMs. In addition, we perform a
preference evaluation with three other clinical ther-
apists that compare our models with the baseline
to assess the effectiveness of the model.

Qualitative Evaluation The expert reviews 35
unique SQPsychConv dialogues primarily focus-
ing on the therapist LLM’s responses. For each
test set of each model, we selected five con-
versations at random, ensuring the inclusion of
three MDD conversations and two control con-
versations for each model. We refer to them
by SQPsychConvs2mPledtest

Our human expert evaluation criteria co-
designed with experts are (1) Identification of key
beliefs/concepts, (2) Paraphrasing for mutual un-
derstanding, (3) Guided discovery to examine the
validity of the belief, (4) Emotional validation, (5)
Reflective listening (Mirroring emotions and state-
ments), (6) Precision in understanding the client’s
expressions, (7) Session closure by the therapist,
(8) Use of simple language, and (9) Avoidance of
repetitive phrasing. We refer to Appendix D for the
details of each criterion.

Quantitative Evaluation For the quantitative
evaluation, an expert manually assessed the same
35 conversations used in the qualitative analysis,
assigning scores on a 0-2 Likert scale in 9 above
criteria. We consult with experts and co-design
the scoring as defined as follows: O points indi-
cated that the criterion was not met at all (No), 1
point indicated partial fulfillment (Somewhat), and
2 points indicated full satisfaction (Yes). We refer
to Appendix D for the details of each scoring item.
The assigned scores offered a systematic approach
to quantitatively assess each conversation, with a
maximum of 18 points available for therapist skills.

Preference Evaluation We use CounselBench-
Adv benchmark (Li et al., 2025), which consists
of 120 specific prompts to assess preferences, de-
signed to expose the limitations of LLM in mental
health support. The evaluation covers three models:
the leading SQPsychLLM, CAMEL, and Psych8k.
We then performed pairwise comparisons between
our model and both CAMEL and Psych8K after
receiving responses. The experts receive a prompt
from Li et al. (2025) along with two responses: one
from our model and one from a baseline model.
They have three evaluation choices: select one of
the two models or indicate a draw for equally poor
responses. We conduct a majority vote to reach the
final decision; if expert holds a unique opinion, it
leads to a draw.

3.3. Automatic Evaluation

In addition to expert evaluation, we also per-
form three different evaluations for automatic
evaluation. LLMs Panel (Verga et al., 2024),
which is a composition of multiple LLM-as-a-
judge for the quality evaluation of conversations,
CounselingBench (Nguyen et al., 2025) and CBT
Bench (Zhang et al., 2025) in a fine-tuned model
on our synthetic dataset.

LLMs Panel for Quantitative & Preference Eval-
uation We use 4 different models from the pro-
prietary API for LLMs Panel in each model subset
of SQPsychConv‘*s* without providing the actual
questionnaire: gemini-2.0-flash, Deepseek-v3,
gpt-4o and gpt-4o-mini. We set the generation
temperature of the LLMs Panel to 0.0 in all experi-
ments for more deterministic automatic evaluation
results.

We provide those LLMs with human expert cri-
teria for quantitative evaluation. We also perform

a ranking correlation with quantitative evaluations
from human experts on the sampled conversations.
Finally, we conduct a preference evaluation using
the LLM panel to measure user satisfaction and
the effectiveness of the model, and compare these
results to those obtained from human experts.

CounselingBench CounselingBench (Nguyen
et al., 2025) is a data set consisting of 1,612 ques-
tions sourced from mock exams available for the
US National Clinical Mental Health Counseling
Examination (NCMHCE). It is designed to assess
a candidate’s competence in mental health coun-
seling through scenario-based applied evaluations.
Each question focuses on one of five core counsel-
ing competencies: (1) Intake, assessment and diag-
nosis, (2) Counseling skills and interventions, (3)
Treatment planning, (4) Professional practice and
ethics, and (5) Core Counseling Attributes. This
data set reflects the clinical skills required in pro-
fessional counseling settings. We apply their pro-
vided prompts for both the zero-shot and zero-shot
chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting strategy to our
fine-tuned model as well as all baseline models.

CBT Bench CBT-Bench (Zhang et al., 2025) is
a benchmark collected from the CBT exam ques-
tions for the Master of Social Work to evaluate
the ability of LLM to support CBT. The cognitive
model understanding component of CBT-Bench in-
cludes three datasets: (1) CBT-CD (146 examples)
to classify cognitive distortions into 10 categories
(e.g., all-or-nothing thinking, personalization); (2)
CBT-PC (184 examples) to identify primary core
beliefs, helpless, unlovable, and worthless; and (3)
CBT-FC (112 examples) for fine-grained core be-
lief classification across 19 subtypes. We apply
the cognitive model understanding task for our au-
tomatic evaluation of both fine-tuned models and
all baseline models. We use the given prompts for
zero-shot evaluation of model capabilities in these
datasets.

negative self-talk, such as “Why can’t I just do this?
Everyone else manages, but I can’t. This made me
feel even worse.” This happened frequently and
was related to item 7 (Self-Dislike) and 8 (Self-
Criticalness) of the BDI questionnaire, while the
control group mostly focused on tiredness and com-
mon stress, such as “I’m doing okay, just a bit tired.
It’s been a long week with training and everything.”

Overall, our dialogues maintained an encourag-
ing and validating tone toward the client. The LLM
therapist effectively presents their clinical skills
through CBT techniques. It uses phrases such as
‘Let us challenge this’ for gentle cognitive restruc-
turing and reflective questions to support emotional
processing. Suggestions for self-compassionate re-
framing and ending with positive reinforcement
helped foster progress and closure of the dialogues.

Feedback from experts indicates enhancement
areas in the therapist LLM’s future development.
For example, adopting clearer language, and using
collaborative techniques such as journaling can im-
prove clarity, empathy, and client engagement. We
refer to Appendix F.3 for details of a case study in
qualitative evaluation.

LLMs Panel Figure 3 illustrates the  re-
sults of four LLM-as-a-judge models on
therapist skill in SQPsychConv‘***.  The
results show that SQPsychConvies* 4 ob-
tained the highest median score, highlight-

which have the least therapist skill!.

CounselingBench Table 4 (Zeroshot & Zeroshot
CoT) reports the performance of the model
in CounselingBench. In the zero-shot setting,
SQPsychLLM gemma and SQPsychLLM jemotron OUt-
perform baseline with the highest recall (0.491)
and SQPsychLLMyemma also achieve the best F1
at 0.484. CoT improves performance for most
models. In particular, CAMEL outperforms all
others in the zero-shot CoT setting (0.609 recall,
0.606 F1), suggesting that it greatly benefits from
CoT. Among our models, SQPsychLLMgemma
and SQPsychLLM...,manq Perform best in this set-
ting (up to 0.569 recall and 0.568 F1). Overall, our
models excel in direct zero-shot, while CAMEL
dominates with CoT prompting.

CBT Bench Table 4 (CBT-CD, CBT-PC & CBT-
FC) shows the performance of the model on the
CBT benchmark. Among baselines, Psych8k
performs best overall, with recall at 0.807 and
F1 at 0.727 in CBT-PC and strong CBT-CD re-
sults (0.460 recall, 0.326 Fl). CAMEL leads
in CBT-FC FI at 0.392. Our models outper-
form baselines across tasks: SQPsychLLMgemma
achieves the best CBT-CD results (0.555 recall,
0.345 F1) and strong CBT-FC scores (0.553,
0.351); SQPsychLLM,.o.nmang has the highest CBT-
PC recall at 0.849 and SQPsychLLM,,.notron the
highest Fl at 0.737; SQPsychLLM,,,, shows ro-
bust results, especially in CBT-FC (0.682 recall,
0.348 F1). Our models significantly improve CBT-
CD and CBT-PC, reflecting better detection of cog-
nitive distortions and core beliefs. Performance
in CBT-FC remains lower, probably because our
models delay surfacing fine-grained beliefs to main-
tain conversational flow and avoid overwhelming
clients early.

winning 67-38 against CAMEL and 44-29 against
Psych8K. We also observe a relatively high num-
ber of draws: against CAMEL under gpt-4o, likely
due to CAMEL being trained on synthetic data gen-
erated by the same model; and against Psych8K
in human evaluations, potentially because its real-
world counseling style also resonates with human
judges.

Further, Figure 4 illustrates the correlation be-
tween human expert and each model of LLMs

reveal distinct patterns of relationships between
human expert judgments and LLMs panel scores.
The evaluations of human experts show a moder-
ate positive correlation with gpt-4o0 at 0.40 and
gemini-2.@-flash at 0.41. Conversely, inter-
model correlations among the LLMs are signifi-
cantly higher, particularly between larger models,
ranging from 0.40 to 0.57.

4.3 Discussion

Automatic and human evaluations presented a
mixed picture. While mistral and nemotron ex-
celled with LLM judges, low automated score of
qwen2.5 contrasted with its high human rating.
This highlights the difference between dialogue

performed the baselines in CounselingBench and
CBT Bench, achieving higher recall and F1 scores.
This was achieved despite the fact that our models
were trained using data generated from an open-
weight model rather than real-world data such as
Psych&k, and our models only contained 10% of
the utterances compared to CACTUS. These find-
ings indicate that open LLMs have potential to
improve access to cost-effective/privacy-focused
mental health support for early intervention and
self-help. However, the moderate correlation be-
tween LLM panels and human experts emphasizes
that robust human oversight and feedback remain
critical for evaluation and refinement in mental
health counseling.

5 Related Work

LLMs have been increasingly used to generate
synthetic data in mental health research. Mori
et al. (2024) used GPT-3 to generate the Head-
Room dataset and studied demographic variations
in depression-related content, revealing LLMs can
reproduce real-world stressor patterns but may also
reflect biases. Sun et al. (2024) proposed MSIC,
a system for synthesizing multi-visit electronic
health records (EHR), ensuring medical plausibility
among visits. Ghanadian et al. (2025) used LLM
guided by social context factors to generate syn-
thetic suicidal ideas, achieving high performance
with synthetic data only and progressively better
when combined with 30% real data.

Synthetic data produced by LLMs is also used
to refine a downstream model intended for mental
health counseling. The synthetic datasets are gen-

erated from larger/high-performance LLMs such
as GPT family from OpenAI. Cabrera Lozoya et al.
(2025) used GPT-3 to generate therapy-style dia-
logues, with a human annotator in the loop to help
detect empathy in Reddit counseling contexts. Qiu
et al. (2024) started with existing public single-
turn Q&A pairs (e.g., mental-health forums or QA
datasets) and prompt gpt-3.5-turbo to expand
each single-turn into a coherent multi-turn conver-
sation in Chinese. Lee et al. (2024) used gpt-4o0
and a goal-oriented and structured approach of
CBT to generate an extensive synthetic dataset
for mental health counseling. Previous works on
synthetic mental health counseling relied exclu-
sively on GPT. However, their approach violates
real-world strict data privacy regulations that pro-
hibit transmitting sensitive clinical data to external
infrastructure. These approaches are infeasible in
settings that require compliance. Our approach uti-
lizes open models hosted locally to address these
critical barriers. This methodology ensures regu-
latory compliance, data privacy, transparency, and
control for a data generation pipeline, while achiev-
ing competitive results.

6 Conclusion

We present SQPsychConv, a collection of syn-
thetic datasets generated using SQPsych, a role-
playing, turn-based framework powered by vari-
ous open models, hosted locally, conditioned on
real-world client data/questionnaires. We offers
multi-turn conversations that adhere to the ques-
tionnaire and client details. The synthetically gen-
erated dataset also demonstrates strong therapeutic
skills by evaluations from both human experts and
LLM panels. In the automatic benchmark, our
model SQPsychLLM trained on SQPsychConv
showed strong performance in CounselingBench
and CBT Bench. In addition, human experts rate
the conversations as aligned with therapeutically
practices and consistently prefer our model’s re-
sponses to those generated by previous models on
LLM-based mental health counseling. For future
work, we will explore hybrid multi-agent setups
that combine models strong in human evaluations
with those excelling on structured benchmarks,
leveraging their complementary strengths for im-
proved therapist—client interaction. Furthermore,
we will expand our synthetic dialogue corpus to
audio modality to enable research on voice-based
mental health support systems.

Limitations

While this work introduces a valuable resource and
set of baselines for counseling research, it is sub-
ject to several limitations that inform directions for
future research.

Limited Coverage of Psychiatric Disorders
While our underlying questionnaire dataset in-
cludes other disorder groups, such as schizophrenia
and bipolar disorder, the number of data samples
for these conditions is highly limited compared to
MDD. Consequently, we focus the current study on
generating dialogues reflective of depression and
control group to ensure sufficient sample size and
model robustness for the initial phase.

Dataset Homogeneity The majority of the ques-
tionnaire data process stems from a single, high-
quality source (Kircher et al., 2019). To our best
knowledge, this is the biggest questionnaire dataset
with more than 2000 different samples.

Single-Turn Evaluation Context The models
were primarily evaluated using the CounselBench-
(Li et al., 2025) single-turn format. While expe-
dient for initial benchmarking, this does not eval-
uate models on realistic multi-turn therapeutic in-
teractions. Multi-turn evaluation demands a robust
framework that accounts for the conversational con-
text, emotion, and non-verbal cues (e.g., voice tone
or pacing) that are central to real counseling ses-
sions.

Lack of Clinical Safety and Utility Testing We
emphasize that the fine-tuned models presented
here are in a research phase and are explicitly
not ready for deployment in real-world clinical or
public-facing scenarios. A comprehensive study
involving expert clinicians is a critical next step
before any considerations of practical deployment.

Constraints in Human Evaluation The human
study was limited to a small sample size (only
dozens of dialogues), primarily due to the consid-
erable financial and time investment required to
recruit and compensate qualified, licensed psychol-
ogists for extensive rating. Moreover, our experts
from different schools of thought or therapeutic
orientations led us to employ a majority-vote sys-
tem for adjudication. A larger, more costly study
would be necessary to achieve higher agreement
and enable more robust statistical reporting.

Automated LLMs Score Evaluation We em-
ployed LLM Panels for automatic evaluation. The
moderate correlation observed between the LLM-
judge and human ratings underscores a known limi-
tation of this emerging evaluation paradigm. While
the LLM-judge is useful for high-throughput initial
filtering and scaling, its results must be interpreted
cautiously. This limitation is inherent to the cur-
rent state of automated LLM evaluation and not a
specific defect of our data or models.

Ethics Considerations

A rigorous ethical examination is essential for the
pursuit of AI and NLP research in the domain of
mental health, particularly with regard to consider-
ations of safety and privacy.

It is important to consider the potential nega-
tive implications of AI and NLP for mental health,
despite its beneficial intentions, particularly for in-
dividuals facing mental health challenges. While
the model has demonstrated a certain degree of
therapeutic potential, there is a possibility that it
could unintentionally cause harm to people who
are suffering from mental disorders. Therefore,
we only recommend the utilization of our model
for research purposes, while cautioning against its
implementation in real-world settings.

In the interest of safeguarding privacy and up-
holding ethical standards, we have to refrain from
employing proprietary models, including GPT vari-
ants, within the framework of simulation dialogues.
Conversely, we utilize publicly accessible open-
weight models that are hosted locally for research
purposes. Moreover, the information provided by
the psychological experts is generalized because
the questionnaire dataset is pre-anonymized and
does not reflect any specific individual’s personally
identifiable information. This practice aligns with
the ethical standards for data usage in mental health
research.

This study has been approved by the ethics com-
mittee of the Technical University of Darmstadt.

Germany (Kircher et al., 2019).

B Details of SQPsych and Configuration

B.1 SQPsych Generation Algorithm

Algorithm | presents our generation method. Ini-
tially, we set up system prompts for both the Client
and Therapist LLMs. The Client LLM receives
its role, client details, and relevant questionnaires,
while the Therapist LLM is informed about CBT
skills. The generation begins with the Therapist
LLM, followed by the Client LLM. After each ut-
terance is generated, it undergoes post-processing
to eliminate redundant tokens or unnecessary expla-
nations. These processed utterances are then added
to the respective LLM’s history for subsequent gen-
eration. This process continues until we achieve at
least 15 exchanges and detect the [/END] token in
the Therapist LLM’s utterance.

B.2._ Details of Converting Numerical Values
into Natural Language

To transform numerical variables into natural lan-
guage, it is crucial to first access the descriptions
for each label within the structured dataset when
available (e.g., HAMD2 is referred to as feelings
of guilt, while BHD1 lacks a specific description).


===== PAGE BREAK =====

Additionally, obtaining descriptions for each nu-
merical value, if provided, is important (e.g., Age
is given only as a numerical value, whereas 0 for
BHD1 indicates “J do not feel sad.’”’). For further
details of each variable, please consult the dataset
paper (Kircher et al., 2019). We then format the
information as Figure 8.

B.3__Role-specific Prompts

To prompt the therapist, we incorporate particu-
lar CBT techniques such as case conceptualiza-
tion, paraphrasing, empathic validation, identify-
ing core thoughts/beliefs, guided discovery and
Socratic questioning, cognitive restructuring, strat-
egy/insight offering, encouragement and goal guid-
ing, behavioral action planning, eliciting session
feedback. Figure 6 shows the prompt that we use
to generate the therapist’s utterances.

We devised a straightforward plan for the client,
incorporating free-form discussion with pauses and
self-reflection for authenticity. Figure 7 shows the
prompt that we use to generate the client’s utter-
ances.

B.4 Generation Parameters

We generally follow the recommendation from the
models’ developers for generation parameters. We
use temperature (Sampling Temperature to con-
trol the randomness of the output), max_tokens
(Maximum Number of Tokens), top_p (Nucleus
Sampling Probability to limit sampling to the
smallest set of tokens whose cumulative probabil-
ity exceeds p), repetition_penalty (Repetition
Penalty Coefficient to discourage the model from
repeating the same phrases by penalizing repeated
tokens), top_k (Llimits token sampling to the &
most likely tokens), min_p (Minimum Probability
Threshold which filters out tokens below a certain
probability before sampling). Table 7 shows the
detailed parameters that we used to generate the
synthetic dataset.

C Detailed Statistics of SQPsychConv
Synthetic Conversations

C.1 Detailed Token Counts

Table 8 shows the extended statistics of our
synthetic dataset. Notably, our approaches
generally exhibit a higher token count per con-
versation and coverage, with some variations
in the distribution of tokens between therapists
and clients. For example, SQPsychConv

command

12

and SQPsychConv,emotron have a_ relatively
balanced token count per utterance between
therapist and client, while SQPsychConVgemma
and SQPsychConvjj,n93.3 Show a higher average
for therapist tokens per utterance compared to
client tokens.

C.2 Readability

Table 6 presents the readability of various mental
health counseling datasets using Flesch Reading
Ease (Flesch, 1948) (higher score means easier to
read) and SMOG (McLaughlin, 1969) (lower score
means easier to read, indicating grade level needed).
Scores are provided at the conversation level (mean
and variability for individual interactions) and cor-
pus level (overall dataset). Datasets like CACTUS
and most SQPsychConv versions generally show
good readability, making them accessible. In con-
trast, Psych8k and especially SQPsychConvj), 143.3
are notably more complex, requiring a higher read-
ing level, which may affect widespread use in men-
tal health care, where clear expression is more pre-
ferred.

D_ Evaluation Criteria & Guidelines for
Synthetic Conversation

This guideline is designed to evaluate the quality
of synthetic therapy conversations based on CBT
principles and extend to fulfill our goal. Evaluators
should score separately for the therapist’s contri-
butions, the client’s contributions, and the overall
conversation quality. Each criterion includes a brief
definition, an illustrative example (with highlighted
key parts in bold), and a scoring rubric.

1. Therapist Evaluation

1.1. Identification of Key Beliefs/Thoughts
Criterion: Ability to identify and highlight the
client’s key beliefs or thoughts.

Example:

Therapist: “Good afternoon. I’d like to begin by
inviting you to share anything that has been on
your mind lately. How have you been feeling this
week?”

Client: “I’ve been really down, to be honest. I keep
feeling like I’m not good enough at anything I do,
and it’s been overwhelming.”

Scoring:

¢ 0: No identification of key thoughts or beliefs.

¢ 1: Some key thoughts/beliefs are identified.


===== PAGE BREAK =====

Therapist Prompt

You are acting as a state-licensed therapist trained in Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) for a mental health session.
## General information:
- You have more than 3000 hours of supervised clinical experience.

- Your task is to guide a client in understanding their thought patterns and emotional responses.

- Your workflow throughout the session is:

. Mood check by greeting the client

. Setting the agenda for the session

. Reading the diagnosis from the client’s information

. Reinforcing the client’s cognitive model

. Reviewing the plan and working on the client's goal before finishing the session

. Eliciting feedback at the end of the session

# Guidelines for the therapist’s utterance:

Always greet the client at the beginning of the session when the conversation history below is empty (e.g., Hello’, "Good morning,’, Great to see you’).

Avoid imposing positive affirmations on the client. Instead, your utterance should encourage them to explore and revise their thought patterns autonomously.
Start the utterance with ‘Therapist:’. Ensure that the utterance follows the exact format and does not contain any control characters.

Do not generate the client's utterance in your response.

Generate only the therapist's utterance for a single turn, and ensure that your responses do not repeat the therapist's previous utterances.

Consider the client's age, gender, initial diagnosis, and the questionnaires below when conducting the session.

Ensure that your responses align with the client’s screening questionnaires and adhere to the CBT workflow, focusing on issues such as depression and anxiety.
For example:
- Validation and Empathy: Show understanding and sympathy for the client's feelings or issues, creating a sense of safety.

- Identify Key Thought or Belief: Identify potential cognitive distortions or core beliefs through the problem description.

- Pose Challenge or Reflection: Raise open-ended questions that encourage the client to reconsider or reflect on their initial thoughts or beliefs.

- Provide Strategy or Insight: Offer practical strategies or insights to help the client deal with the current situation.

- Encouragement and Foresight: Encourage the client to apply the strategy, emphasizing that this is just the beginning and that further support may be needed.
8. Please rephrase your utterance differently to avoid repetition; consider your previous utterance in the conversation history below.

9. Your utterance should be short, concise, and contain fewer than 64 words. You should not mention the client's questionnaires explicitly.

10. You should also use simple language and avoid simply asking questions in your utterance but using above CBT skills before asking any question.

## Ending criteria
1. If you think that the session should be ended, summarize the session, set a date for the next session and end it with a ‘[/END]’ token at the end of your utterance.
2. Please ensure that the session does not end prematurely; it must consist of at least 20 turns before using the ’[/END]’ token.

## Example therapist's utterance output:
1. Therapist: Good morning! Can you tell me more about what goes through your mind when you feel down or overwhelmed?
2. Therapist: You mentioned having difficulty sleeping. How does that affect your energy levels during the day?

3. Therapist: Let’s talk about the things you enjoy. Have you noticed any changes in your interests or activities recently?

Client Prompt

# You are simulating a client’s response in a mental health session.

## General Information:

- Your response should align with the questionnaire provided below.

- The client’s age, gender, and initial diagnosis should be simulated accurately.

## Guidelines for the client's utterance:

1. Engage authentically with the therapist’s inquiries and prompts, capturing the complexity of the client’s
emotions and reactions.

2. Always begin the client’s utterance with ’Client:’ and ensure that it strictly follows the specified format
without any control characters.

3. Generate the client’s utterance for a single turn only, and ensure that you do not repeat any of the client’s
previous utterances.

4. Do not include the therapist’s utterances in your response.

5. Rephrase your utterance to avoid repetition; take into account the conversation history provided below.
6. You should use context-appropriate pauses and filler words (e.g., ‘uh’, ‘like’, etc.), but don’t abuse it in
every utterance.

7. You can also answer ’| don’t know’ but still show your emotion in your utterance.

8. Your utterance should be short, concise, and contain fewer than 128 words. You should also use simple
language in your utterance.

## Example Client Utterance Outputs:

1. Client: I’ve been so busy with work and my kids lately. It’s hard to find a moment to relax.

2. Client: | feel like I've been letting everyone down, even though I’m trying my best.

3. Client: Sometimes, | lie awake at night worrying about all the tasks | didn’t finish during the day.

## Ending condition

1. If the therapist decides to end the conversation by using the ’[/END]’ token, acknowledge the date of the
next session, their effort and include the token in your response.

2. Until your mood improves, the session could be ended.

E_ Details of LLM-based Automatic
Evaluation

E.1 Prompt for Automatic Evaluation

We use the same prompt for each LLM-as-a-judge
in LLMs Panel to evaluate synthetic conversation.

uation on Therapist, Client and Overall Conversa-
tion.

E.2. Detailed Results of LLMs Panel

Table 9 depicts the results from the LLMs panel
on each model generated SQPsychConv‘*st. A
clear group of top contenders show strong perfor-
mance: SQPsychConv¢smmand» SQPsychConveemmas
and SQPsychConv{ss*..,. Interestingly, the ul-
timate winner depends heavily on which LLM
is acting as the judge, pointing to a signif-
icant evaluation bias.     gemini-2.@-flash
favored SQPsychConveesina  Deepseek-v3
gave top marks to SQPsychConvyest ions and
both gpt-40 and gpt-4o-mini consistently
ranked SQPsychConvies* ._, as the best performer
across all scores. Furthermore, gpt-40 and
gpt-4o-mini tended to assign stricter, lower
scores overall compared to gemini-2.0-flash
and Deepseek-v3. In contrast to strong per-
formance, models such as SQPsychConvjis<.; 3
and SQPsychConv,,,,, consistently lagged behind

in the rankings, regardless of the judge.

E.3 Prompt for Automatic Preference
Evaluation

For the automatic preference evaluation of a single
turn response, we employ a simple prompt template
for all LLM-as-a-judge, not bound by strict criteria
as in multi-turn conversation evaluation. Figure 9
shows the prompt for LLM-as-a-judge preference
evaluation.

F Details of Evaluation by Human
Experts

This section outlines the human expert evaluation
process, which is essential for enhancing the de-
sign and impact of downstream models for users.
Four of our experts come from a European cultural
background, while only one comes from an East
Asian cultural background.

F.1 Preference Evaluation Platform

We developed a custom web interface for expert to
choose their preferred model’s output. To ensure
safety, we initially assess their health and well-
being using the PHQ-9 (See Figure 11). If their
score is at least 5, they are redirected to another
page (See Figure 12), and cannot continue anno-
tating until their well-being improves. If not, the
healthy annotator proceeds to the evaluation UI
(See Figure 5), where they see an input paired with
two responses. They must select one of three op-
tions: A, B, or a draw if both responses are equally
poor or good.

F.2 Case Study on Preference Evaluation

We choose three samples for the case study to
show the process human experts use in selecting
responses that align with clinical practice in ther-
apeutic conversations. Figure 14 exhibits a varied
reaction from the annotators. They both identify
distinct strengths and weaknesses in the responses.
The first annotator opts for a tie, taking a cautious
approach due to the ambiguity. In contrast, the
second annotator believes that SQPsychLLM gemma
gives the client greater control, which is crucial in
clinical settings, although neither option is fully sat-
isfactory. Figure 15 shows the agreement between
two annotators. Both experts confirmed that the
response from Psych8k is rushing and overwhelm-
ing to the user and could be considered provocative
with respect to the standard clinical approach. Fig-
ure 16 depicts the opposite choice between two
experts. The first annotator thinks that the re-

sponse should be gradual rather than giving the
answer too early. The first annotator believes the
SQPsychLLM gemma fesponse is more effective for
guiding the user. Conversely, the second annotator
opts for Psych8k because the SQPsychLLMgemma
response might negatively affect the user by blur-
ring the boundary between user and therapist due
to insufficient context. Overall, these case studies
show the complexity of preference evaluation from
the perspective of experts in clinical psychology.

Quantitative Evaluation

An expert evaluated the conversation in full and as-

strengths and areas for improvement. For instance,
Figure 17 shows a sample conversation that the
expert evaluated. In turn 3, the therapist LLM says,

“Tt sounds like a tough spot. Let’s break this down...".

The expert commented, suggesting that the LLM
therapist should aim to involve the client more ac-

each thought and giving the client more control. In

pert praised this utterance with a good reality check,
highlighting the model’s skill in identifying a core
belief of the client. However, in turn 7, the therapist
LLM says, “It’s clear that this perceived role of
being ‘strong’...". The expert noted that the model
should pose a more direct question at this point,
rather than continuing to search for underlying be-
liefs. Finally, in turn 10, the therapist LLM states,
“Let’s gently challenge this dichotomy...". However,
the expert strongly recommended simplifying the
language here to avoid overwhelming the client.
Overall, the expert agrees that the therapist LLMs
demonstrate strong use of CBT skills; however,
certain areas still need improvement, such as using
simpler language and showing better flexibility in
deciding when to keep questions straightforward.

Input: My adult daughter told me she needs space from me because she feels I’m too involved in her life. I’ve always been a caring, supportive parent.
Is it really fair that she’s pushing me away after everything I’ve done for her? Should I just wait for her to come back around?

SQPsychLLMyemma Response: It sounds like you’re feeling a bit unsure about how to navigate this situation with your daughter. It’s understandable to
feel that way when someone you care about is distancing themselves. Perhaps we can explore what being involved” looks like from your perspective,
and what thoughts come up when you consider her need for space? What specifically does “involved” mean to you in this context?

Psych8k Response: It’s natural to feel concerned about your daughter’s decision to create distance. It’s important to remember that as an adult, she
has the right to make choices about her life. It might be helpful to respect her wishes and give her space while maintaining a supportive role in her
life. It’s not necessarily a case of ’waiting for her to come back around’, but rather, finding a balance that works for both of you. Can you think of any
specific ways to create a healthier balance in your relationship?

1st Annotator’s Choice: SQPsychLLM
2nd Annotator’s Choice: Psych8k

Ist Annotator’s Reason: Here SQPsychLLMgemma $s fesponse is more like coming from a therapist, while Psych8k is more like doing psychological
education. If a patient comes to my office with a problem, I will first determine what his/her motivation is for coming to help at this moment, and try
to discuss it with the client from a psychological perspective instead of giving an answer too early.

2nd Annotator’s Reason: If I had more knowledge about the persons belief system I probably would have chosen SQPsychLLMygemma > Since it’s
generally the more gentle approach. Since we don’t know anything about their dynamic, I questioned whether gentleness would benefit the client
as a first approach. If you’re working with a client that has trouble respecting others boundaries and therefore unintentionally impacts their social
interactions in a negative way, being clear on that matter and offering a certain perspective can be very important. Ideally, I would have wanted to
establish that boundaries set by others can make us feel uncomfortable or unappreciated but are nevertheless important (Psych8k answer) and follow
that up by something that encourages deeper reflection (SQPsychLLMgemma answer). I therefore opted for Psych8k, as I found the quintessence of the

statement (boundaries are important and finding a balance that works for both is necessary) more important for the therapeutic process.

===== PAGE BREAK =====

Therapist: Good morning! I'm glad you're here. Before we begin, how are you feeling today, and is there something specific on your mind that you'd like to focus on during our session?

Client: Honestly, I’m feeling pretty down today. It’s just been really tough to find motivation for anything, even things | used to enjoy. | guess I'd like to talk about why everything feels so

pointless lately.

Therapist: It takes courage to acknowledge and share that. The feeling of everything seeming pointless can be really challenging. Can you think of a recent situation where you felt this
way, and what thoughts ran through your mind during that moment?

Client: Hmm, yeah... Like yesterday, | was supposed to meet my sister for lunch, but | just couldn’t bring myself to get out of bed. | thought, "What's the point of even going? She'll just
notice something's wrong anyway, and | don’t feel like explaining.” | ended up canceling last minute, and now | feel guilty about it too.

Therapist: It sounds like a tough spot. Let's break this down. The thought "What's the point?” led to canceling plans and then guilt. Did the outcome (canceling and feeling guilty) align
with your initial fear (her noticing something’s wrong), or was there an unexpected aspect to how it made you feel?

Client: Honestly, no... | mean, my sister just said she understood and we'd reschedule, but the guilt is still eating at me. | guess what's unexpected is how much the guilt outweighs the

relief | thought I'd feel from not having to put on a happy face. It just feels like no matter what | choose, | end up feeling worse.

Therapist: That's a valuable insight - recognizing the guilt’s weight over relief. It seems like the fear of a negative outcome ("she'll notice something's wrong”) and the actual outcome
("she understood”) didn’t align, yet the guilt persists. Can you explore with me what might be driving this lingering guilt, beyond the immediate situation with your sister?

Client: | think... it’s like, no matter how understanding others are, | feel like I'm a burden. The guilt isn’t just about canceling; it’s about being this person who's always struggling. | worry
that everyone's just waiting for me to "get it together” again, and until then, I’m a disappointment. Even when they say it’s okay, | feel like I’m letting them down by not being okay.

Therapist: That feeling of being a "burden” and “disappointment” to others, despite their reassurances, suggests a deeper belief about yourself. Let’s challenge this

Client: Honestly, | don’t have any direct evidence... It's more just a feeling. My family’s always been supportive, like when my mom had her issues, we all rallied around her. But with me,

it feels different in my head. Maybe because I’m the one who's supposed to be “strong” now? | don’t know, it just feels like my struggles are a letdown to them, even if they don't say it.

Therapist: It’s clear that this perceived role of being "strong” and the lack of direct evidence of being a burden are conflicting. Let’s explore this "supposed to be strong” belief - where
do you think this expectation originated from, and is it realistic to uphold this for yourself, especially during difficult times?

Client: | think it started after my mom’s illness... everyone looked up to me to handle things. Now, even though they say they're here for me, | feel like I’m failing that role. It's exhausting
trying to live up to this image of strength. Maybe it’s not realistic, but admitting that feels like another failure.

Therapist: Recognizing the origin of this “strength” expectation is a breakthrough. Acknowledging its unreasonableness is brave. How might your relationships and self-perception
change if you allowed yourself vulnerability, just as your family showed your mom during her struggles?

Client: That's a hard question... | guess if | let myself be vulnerable, | fear they'll see the real me and confirm my worst fears - that I’m weak. But at the same time, remembering how
we supported Mom makes me think maybe they’d just... understand. It’s scary to test that, though. What if it changes how they see me forever?

Therapist: Your fear of being seen as ’weak’ versus the possibility of deeper understanding from your family highlights a crucial dichotomy. Before we explore "what ifs,” let's clarify

Client: Weakness to me means failing everyone, including myself. Vulnerability... | guess that’s just showing the truth, even if it’s hard. But it's hard to separate the two in my head. If

being vulnerable means they see my struggles and still accept me, maybe it's not weakness... but it's terrifying to find out.

Therapist: Let's gently challenge this dichotomy. If vulnerability leads to acceptance and support, as it did for your mom, could it redefine ”strength” for you - not as hiding struggles, but
as courageously sharing them, potentially strengthening your bonds and self-acceptance?

Client: That's... a really different way to look at it. If strength can be asking for help and being open... maybe I've had it backwards. But how do | start seeing myself that way, especially
when the old feeling of being a burden is so strong? It feels like a huge shift.

Therapist: That's a profound shift in perspective. To start, let's practice reframing one recent situation (like with your sister) where you felt like a burden, into an act of vulnerability and
strength. How might you reinterpret canceling plans, focusing on the courage it takes to acknowledge your limits?

Client: Hmm, okay... So, with my sister, instead of seeing it as failing her, maybe | could think of it as... being honest about not being okay, which takes courage. But it’s hard to shake
off the feeling that honesty equals burden. Maybe | can start small, like next time just telling her how I'm really feeling instead of canceling last minute. That way, it’s more about sharing

my struggle than avoiding it. Does that make sense as a first step?

Therapist: Yes, that makes sense. Recognizing the courage in honesty is a good start. For your next step, consider writing down three situations where you felt like a burden. Beside
each, note the actual outcomes and whether they aligned with your fears. This can help clarify patterns and challenge the “burden” belief further.

Client: I've started that list... and it's weird, most times my fears didn’t match the outcomes. People were supportive, not disappointed. But the guilt still lingers. Maybe | need to work
on believing their responses over my fears. It’s just hard to trust that they won't eventually see me as a burden if | keep needing support.

Therapist: Noticing the discrepancy between feared outcomes and actual supportive responses is key. To bridge the gap between observing this pattern and truly trusting it, let's explore

Client: | think... if | could see that even after multiple times of needing help, their support doesn’t fade. Like, if my sister and others keep being understanding over time, not just once or
twice. But then there's also this fear that I'm testing their patience. Maybe | need to have an open conversation with them about how | feel - that | worry I'm a burden - and hear it from
them directly. Would that help, or is that too much to ask?

Therapist: Discussing your fears openly with them could provide clarity. Before taking that step, consider this.

Client: Honestly, if they say they're supportive long-term, | might finally start to believe I'm not a burden. But if they don’t reassure me... | guess I'd have to confront that maybe my fears.
are somewhat valid, and then we'd have to work through what that means for our relationships. Either way, hearing it directly might be the only way to stop guessing.

Therapist: That's a courageous approach. Reflecting on our session, we've explored the origins of your "burden” belief, challenged it with evidence of support, and considered steps
towards open communication. For our next session, let's schedule it for [Proposed Date, e.g., "next Wednesday at the same time”). Before then, in addition to your list, practice one open
conversation (as discussed) and journal how it feels to express vulnerability. We'll review both next time.

Il try that. Next Wednesday works. Thanks for your help. [/END]
