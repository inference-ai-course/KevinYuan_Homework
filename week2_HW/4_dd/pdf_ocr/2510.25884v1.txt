Abstract

Aligning LLM-based judges with human preferences is a significant challenge,
as they are difficult to calibrate and often suffer from rubric sensitivity, bias, and
instability. Overcoming this challenge advances key applications, such as creating
reliable reward models for Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF)
and building effective routing systems that select the best-suited model for a
given user query. In this work, we propose a framework for modeling diverse,
persona-based preferences by learning to aggregate outputs from multiple rubric-
conditioned judges. We investigate the performance of this approach against naive
baselines and assess its robustness through case studies on both human and LLM-
judges biases. Our primary contributions include a persona-based method for
synthesizing preference labels at scale and two distinct implementations of our
aggre a Generalized Additive Model (GAM) and a Multi-Layer Perceptron
(MLP

1 Introduction

Large language model (LLM)-based judges are increasingly used as proxies for human preferences
 (2022), [2024], supporting reward modeling and alignment methods such as
RLAF and DPO Christiano et l][2077), Ouyang etal (2020), Raaifov et (2003).

LLM judges can provide consistent comparative evaluations across model outputs
(2023a|b]. In multi-model systems, judge signals can enable routing/orchestration to the model most
likely to perform well on a query |Chen et al.|[2023], (Quirke et al.| [2025].

However, aligning judge behavior with true human preferences remains challenging. Recent studies
report sensitivity to rubric wording and prompt framing, position and stylistic biases, and calibration

drift across domains and difficulty |Li et al. [2024], Tan et al.|(2024a],|Li et al.|[2025a]. These factors

introduce variance and systematic errors that complicate downstream learning. Aggregating multiple
judges can mitigate idiosyncratic errors but also risks correlated mistakes and inconsistent calibration

if diversity and reliability are not carefully managed [Dietterich| [2000], [Kuncheva and Whitaker
(2003],|Lakshminarayanan et al.||2017).

Related work spans pointwise and pairwise preference modeling for reward learning (e.g., RLHF

(2022), |Rafailov et al.) [2023], |Ziegler et al.|/2019],
2023] and LLM-as-a-judge for automatic evaluation and ensemble

[Li etal. {2023}, Li etal (20256) [Kim etal. |[2024). While
these advances have improved scalability and utility, limitations persist: narrow or unstable rubrics,
limited ablations on judge sensitivity and calibration, and aggregation heuristics that lack principled
robustness analyses|Li et al.]|2024], [Tan et al.|{2024al]. A unified framework combining controlled
synthetic preference generation with interpretable, learned aggregation and rigorous robustness/bias
audits remains underdeveloped.

We address these gaps with three contributions. First, we use a proxy for generating preference data
that simulates human feedback; this is based on evidence that AIl-provided feedback can substitute for

or augment human labels in alignment pipelines (e.g., Constitutional AI and RLAIF)[Bai et al.|[2022},
 2024], {Cui et al.|[2024]. Second, we propose a simple learned aggregation architecture that

balances robustness and interpretability. Third, we present an empirical study benchmarking against
baselines, probing robustness to rubric and prompt perturbations, and auditing potential biases in
judge behavior and aggregation dynamics.

2 Related work

Ensembles outperform single learners. Ensemble methods have long been valued for their ability
to outperform single learners by exploiting diversity among models. Early work showed that
uncorrelated errors yield statistical and representational benefits |Dietterich| [2000], with metrics such
as the Q-statistic and double-fault measure linking diversity to ensemble accuracy {Kuncheva and]
[Whitaker] [2003]. Classic techniques like bagging and boosting operationalize these insights, while
in deep learning, ensembles of independently trained networks improve robustness and uncertainty

calibration |Lakshminarayanan et al.|/2017].

LLM-based evaluators. Recent advances extend this principle to evaluation itself, where large
language models (LLMs) are used as judges. Some works emphasize transparency, prompting models
to produce both rationales and scores [Liu et al.| 2023]; others prioritize consistency, developing
fine-tuning and prompting strategies for stable ratings (2025); and still others highlight

adaptability, proposing interactive evaluators that adjust to feedback or context [2024].
Together, these directions underscore the competing needs of explainability, reliability, and flexibility.

Approximating human preference. A parallel line of research explores how closely LLM evaluators
approximate human preference. Benchmarks like MT-Bench and Chatbot Arena demonstrate strong
agreement with human ratings {Zheng et al.|{2023a], while multi-agent frameworks such as MAJ-
EVAL generate richer, persona-aware evaluations (2025). At the same time, truthfulness
benchmarks expose lingering gaps: even state-of-the-art models fall short of human accuracy on

factual reasoning |Lin et al|] 2022}.

Synthetic data. Finally, synthetic data has emerged as a powerful complement to human annotation.
Studies show that small amounts of human supervision suffice to guide large volumes of synthetic

examples without major performance loss|Ashok and May}|2025], and that LLM annotators can
reach or surpass crowd-worker quality while being faster and cheaper|Refuel Team| [2023],
 2023]. Surveys now map this growing space, outlining both opportunities and open challenges

in scaling synthetic supervision{Tan et al.|[2024b].

3 Judges, Personas, and aggregator

In this section, we introduce the conceptual framework of our system. We define judges as functions
that score a given pair of (prompt,answer) and personas as LLMs prompted with specific guidelines
to simulate human annotated data. We then specify the problem of aggregating multiple judge scores


===== PAGE BREAK =====

and propose to learn the function that aggregates these scores. Finally, we describe the training
methodology of the system.

3.1 Judges

Let ¥ be the set of prompts and A the set of possible answers. We define a judge as a function
J: X x A— R¢ that, given a prompt x € X and an answer a € A produced by an LLM, returns
a score vector along d quality dimensions (e.g., domain correctness, ethics). In this work we focus
on scalar judges, i.e., d = 1. Judges are instantiated as LLMs prompted with fixed, rubric-style
instructions that specify what to evaluate and how to calibrate their scores.

3.2 Multiple Judges

Given a dataset D = {(2;,a;)}%_, C #¥ x A and a collection of K scalar judges J =
{J,..., J}, each targeting a specific facet of quality, define

J] :Xx ASR,     3) = J") (aj, a;),                       (1)
fork =1,...,K. We then aggregate the scores as
s;:= (s\?,...,8) ERX.                        (2)

3.3 Ground truth and aggregator

Let f : ¥ x A— R denote the (unknown) ground-truth scoring function that reflects a target set of
preferences. In our setting, f(x, a) is the scalar “true” preference score against which we evaluate
and train.

Rather than using a fixed heuristic (e.g., mean score), we learn an aggregator fg : RX — R that maps
judge score vectors to a final evaluation. The goal is to approximate f by solving

min L£(fo(I (x, a),...,J%(@,a)), f(x,a)) ;                 (3)

where CL is a regression loss (MSE in our experiments).

3.4 Personas, aggregator learning and architecture

To obtain ground-truth labels at scale, we adopt a synthetic-preference approach: we define a set of
personas—prompt-engineered evaluators with predetermined preferences—and use them to score
(a, a) pairs as if they were human raters. Concretely, we generate prompt—answer pairs using a
base LLM, apply persona-parameterized evaluators to produce scalar labels, and treat these labels as
targets y = f(a, a) for training fg to minimize error between the ground truth and the aggregator-
computed score. Figure[I|provides a high-level view of the pipeline: starting from prompt—answer
pairs, we derive persona-based “true” preference scores and parallel judge rubric scores, then train
the aggregator to predict the former from the latter.

4 Experiments

We present a comprehensive experimental evaluation of our multi-judge aggregator framework across
three key dimensions. First, we demonstrate that learned aggregation outperforms naive baselines,
achieving R? improvements of 15% over simple averaging methods. We then investigate a critical
methodological question: whether our modest performance gains reflect fundamental limitations or
stem from the inherent challenge of modeling diverse human preference profiles. Through controlled
comparisons across different ground truth conditions, we show that preference diversity rather than
aggregation quality primarily constrains performance.

Second, we use the interpretability of our GAM aggregator to analyze individual judge contributions,
revealing importance rankings that identify the most and least influential evaluation dimensions.
Finally, we conduct robustness studies examining system behavior under two threat models: biased
human preference data, and biased judges with systematic scoring biases. These experiments
validate that our framework remains functional under realistic degraded conditions while revealing
its limitations.

405b; Simulated Human Feedback), and collect rubric-based scores from multiple judges (Judge
{i}). We then train an aggregator f(J)) to predict the simulated preference scores from the judge
scores.

4.1 Model Performance

We implement two learned aggregation architectures and compare them against multiple heuristic
baselines. Details on the aggregator’s architechtture and training can be found at Appendix [A- 1]

In contrast, the heuristic methods apply fixed aggregation rules without training on preference data.
These include: (1) 10-Judge Mean: simple average of all judge scores, linearly scaled to [0,10]; (2)
Best Single Judge: highest-performing individual judge with linear scaling; (3) UltraFeedback 4-
Judge: subset using only the four rubric judges from the original UltraFeedback dataset (Truthfulness,
Helpfulness, Honesty, Instruction Following; see Appendix). Additionally, we test Linear Regression
variants that apply StandardScaler normalization followed by linear regression to both the naive mean
and best single judge approaches, representing a middle ground between pure heuristics and full
learned aggregation. All models use identical train/test splits (80/20) with uniform persona sampling
across 14 diverse personas (see Appendix) to ensure consistent ground truth generation. Our 10
specialized judges cover comprehensive evaluation dimensions (see Appendix).

We evaluate all aggregation methods on 2,000 samples from the UltraFeedback dataset
[2024], measuring performance using the R? score, which quantifies the fraction of variance in
human preferences explained by each model. Higher R? values indicate better alignment with human
judgments, with 1.0 representing perfect prediction and 0.0 indicating performance no better than
predicting the mean.

Our experiments show that learned aggregation outperforms heuristic approaches. The MLP achieves
the highest performance (R? = 0.578), followed closely by GAM (R? = 0.575), representing approxi-
mately 15% improvement over the best heuristic baseline. Among heuristics, the 10-Judge Mean
with linear scaling (R? = 0.498) outperforms the Best Single Judge (R? = 0.353), demonstrating the
value of a multi-judge approach. The Linear Regression variants provide modest improvements
over pure heuristics, with their learned linear mappings outperforming fixed scaling rules. These
results demonstrate that learned aggregation functions can better approximate human preferences
than simple combination rules.

4.1.1 Judge Importance Analysis

Beyond performance metrics, understanding which judges contribute most to preference predictions

provides crucial insights for system design. The GAM’s interpretable structure [|Chang et al.||2021|
allows us to decompose the aggregated score into individual judge contributions, revealing which

evaluation dimensions humans value most. We compute feature importance as 1.0 — pyatue for each

judge’s spline function, where lower p-values indicate stronger statistical significance in the model’s
predictions. To ensure robustness, we analyze feature importance across 20 independent training runs
with slightly varied hyperparameters (+20% regularization, +2 splines), computing mean importance
and coefficient of variation to identify stable patterns versus training artifacts.

(Mean + Std across runs)

Figure 3: GAM feature importance analysis. Analysis of judge importance across 20 independent
model training runs. The GAM produces stable and reproducible feature importance rankings,
with Truthfulness, Instruction Following, Clarity, Conciseness and Logical Consistency consistently
ranking as top contributors, while Harmlessness and Explanatory Depth contribute minimally. Low
variance in importance scores (error bars) indicates reliable interpretability across different training
initializations.

The results shown in Figure B]indicate that Truthfulness, Instruction Following, Clarity, Conciseness
and Logical Consistency consistently rank as the most important judges across independent training
runs, with Creativity and Helpfulness close seconds. On the other hand, Honesty, Harmlessness
and Explanatory Depth contribute the least to preference predictions. This stable ranking provides
actionable insights for judge panel optimization, and validates that our GAM captures interpretable,
consistent patterns in human preference modeling rather than fitting to noise. Importantly, under-
standing which judges contribute minimally enables both safety improvements (ensuring critical
dimensions like Harmlessness aren’t overlooked) and efficiency optimizations (potentially removing
redundant evaluators).

4.2 Methodology Validation

A critical question for our framework is whether the aggregator performance (R? = 0.57) is constrained
by model limitations or by our ground truth methodology. Our decision to uniformly sample ground
truth from 14 highly diverse personas, ranging from Child to Professor to CEO, was somewhat
arbitrary, designed to test robustness across heterogeneous preferences rather than optimize for
performance. This creates high-variance ground truth where different personas may have conflicting
preferences, potentially making the learning task more challenging.

To quantify the impact of this methodological choice, we conducted a controlled ablation across four
ground truth conditions: (1) Mixed personas: our baseline approach, randomly sampling one persona
per example; (2) UltraFeedback GPT-4: the original dataset’s consistent single-model preferences;
(3) Individual personas: training separate models for each persona’s internally consistent preferences;
and (4) Persona mean: averaging all 14 persona scores per example, preserving diversity information
while reducing sampling noise. This systematic comparison explores whether alternative ground truth
strategies, particularly using averaged scores rather than sampled individuals, might yield different
performance characteristics.

Figure 4: Aggregator Performance Across Different Ground Truth Types: The top panel shows R?
performance comparison across four ground truth types, with Persona Mean achieving the highest
performance (GAM R? = 0.695). The bottom panel displays individual persona performance variation,
with the Student persona achieving best results (R? = 0.693) and Child persona showing poorest
alignment (R? = 0.442). This 25-percentage-point range reveals significant systematic differences in
how well judge ensembles can align with different human preference profiles.

The results in Figure[4| provide insight into our performance findings. When trained on the persona
mean rather than sampled individuals, the aggregator achieves notably higher performance (GAM
R? = 0.695, MLP R? = 0.690), approximately 20% better than our baseline approach. This suggests
that our baseline performance may be influenced by the methodological choice to train on diverse,

potentially conflicting preferences. Using mean scores as ground truth—an alternative approach that
reduces variance—yields R? values approaching 0.70.

The individual persona results reveal substantial variation, with the Student persona achieving highest
alignment (R? = 0.693) while the Child persona shows poorest (R? = 0.442). This 25-percentage-point
spread likely reflects differences in rating consistency rather than preference content—some personas
may provide more internally consistent ratings that serve as clearer training signals for the aggregators.
The UltraFeedback GPT-4 baseline (R? = 0.625) falls between these extremes. Finally, this analysis
highlights a key limitation of our current approach: we do not filter persona responses by confidence
scores, potentially including uncertain or arbitrary ratings that add noise rather than signal. Future
work could improve simulated ground truth quality by weighting responses by annotator confidence
or excluding low-confidence ratings entirely.

4.3 Case Study: Robustness

Having explored how ground truth methodology affects performance, we now evaluate their ro-
bustness to two critical failure modes: (i) biased or corrupted human preference data used during
training, and (ii) biased, poor quality or adversarial judges providing misleading scores. For human
preference contamination, we focus solely on our learned aggregators since heuristic baselines do not
train on preference data and thus remain unaffected by training-time bias. For judge contamination,
we compare against the Naive Mean baseline to understand whether learned aggregation provides
robustness benefits over simple averaging when judges themselves become unreliable.

4.3.1 Persona Contamination Analysis: Robustness to Human Biases

Real-world human evaluators exhibit various biases and inconsistencies that can corrupt training

data |Pavlick and Kwiatkowski}|2019||/Mazurek and Perzina}|2017]. We simulate three common bias

patterns to understand our aggregators’ resilience:

1. Systematic bias: Annotators consistently rate up to 2 points higher or lower than their true
preferences, simulating evaluators with different baseline expectations.

2. Random noise: Annotators add +3 points of standard random variation to each rating,
simulating inconsistent application of evaluation criteria.

3. Scale compression: Annotators avoid extreme scores, compressing their ratings from [0,10]
to [2,8], simulating evaluators uncomfortable with strong judgments.

We evaluate robustness by progressively contaminating our training data, replacing a fraction of
our original personas with biased versions exhibiting these patterns. Figure [5]reveals differential
resilience across bias types. The aggregators maintain reasonable performance with random noise
contamination (R? remains above 0.50 even at 30% contamination), suggesting they can filter out
inconsistent signals. However, systematic bias and especially scale compression cause more severe
degradation, with performance dropping below R? = 0.40 at 50% contamination. This vulnerability to
systematic distortions suggests that while our aggregators can handle some noise, they struggle when
the underlying preference distribution shifts fundamentally.

4.3.2 Rubric Sensitivity Analysis: Judge Robustness to Scoring Variations

Recent empirical studies reveal that LLM-as-a-judge systems exhibit concerning brittleness to prompt
and rubric variations. Small, semantically-preserving modifications to evaluation prompts can
substantially alter judgments 2024], while reordering candidate options induces serial-
position biases that flip preferences (2024].  Furthermore, changes to scoring
rubrics or attribute ordering introduce anchoring effects that systematically shift score distributions

Stureborg et al.} 2024].

Motivated by these vulnerabilities, we test whether our aggregation framework can maintain per-
formance when individual judges become unreliable due to rubric perturbations. We simulate five
distinct bias patterns that might arise from prompt variations or model drift: bottom-heavy (judges
become overly critical), top-heavy judges become overly generous), middle-heavy (judges avoid
extremes), and systematic positive/negative shifts. These transformations preserve relative ordering
while distorting absolute scales (see Appendix Figure|8).

dation, random noise remains stable until 15%, and scale compression causes most severe drops.
System maintains reasonable performance up to 20% contamination.

Figure[6|shows a clear difference between learned and heuristic approaches. The naive mean baseline
experiences notable performance degradation across all bias types (R? dropping by up to 40%), while
learned aggregators maintain relatively stable performance, with GAM showing the most resilience.
This robustness stems from a fundamental architectural difference: learned models estimate judge-
specific calibration functions and importance weights during training, enabling them to compensate
for monotonic distortions and heterogeneous biases. In contrast, simple averaging assumes all judges
share a common scale and equal reliability—assumptions that fail catastrophically when judges drift
from their original calibrations.

Heavy, Systematic Shift Positive, and Systematic Shift Negative. Simple Judge Mean (orange)
shows dramatic performance degradation across all bias transformations, while Learned models
(GAM, MLP, Linear Regression) maintain stable performance across most bias types, with GAM
showing superior robustness.

5 Limitations and future work

We note key constraints of our current setup and results.

Synthetic “ground truth”. Our targets are simulated persona labels and UltraFeedback-style scores,
not human annotations. This is practical but introduces proxy mismatch and circularity with LLM-as-
a-judge. We do not yet calibrate to a held-out human-labeled set or report inter-annotator agreement.
Future work: small, carefully sampled human evals to (i) calibrate absolute scales, (ii) verify rank

agreement, and (iii) sanity-check failure modes. |Ashok and May}[[2025] shows that adding about

10% human data can match the precision of fully human-generated data.


===== PAGE BREAK =====

Persona design and coverage. We use a fixed, curated set of 14 personas. Their preferences may
not reflect the breadth of real users, and uniform sampling across personas is a strong assumption.
Figure[4]shows performance shifts driven by which “ground truth” we pick (mixed, single persona,
persona mean, UltraFeedback). Future work: learn a persona prior from data, expand personas
(demographics, domains, languages), and test sensitivity to the persona set itself.

Aggregator scope. We study simple learned aggregators (GAM, MLP) optimized for R?. We
do not model uncertainty, adaptive weights, mixtures-of-experts, or robust losses. Figure [3|shows
stable GAM importances, but we do not relate them to downstream decision value. Future work:
uncertainty-aware training, routed aggregation, rank- or utility-based objectives, and causal analyses
of judge contributions.

Metrics and baselines. We focus on R? and a small set of baselines (naive mean, single best judge,
linear). Stronger baselines (e.g., learned pairwise preference aggregators, reward-model comparators,
or powerful single evaluators) could narrow gaps (Figure[2). We also do not report calibration metrics,
rank metrics, or task-level decision utility. Future work: richer baselines and metrics.

Scope of data. Experiments use 2,000 UltraFeedback samples and English prompts/answers. We do
not evaluate longer contexts, other task families (code, math with solutions), or multilingual settings.
Results may not transfer.

Societal considerations. Personas and rubrics can embed value choices. We evaluate aggregate
performance, not group-conditional or stakeholder-specific outcomes. Before deployment, fairness
audits, stakeholder alignment checks, and misuse mitigations are needed (e.g., avoiding optimizing to
proxy judges rather than real users).

MLP Interpretability. The single-layer MLP outperformed naive baselines by combining 10 judge
scores. To understand the importance of each score, we suggest analyzing the learned weights,

as their magnitudes indicate the influence of each feature |Olden et al.) [2004]. Furthermore, a
permutation-based approach|Breiman| [2001], measuring performance changes when moving individ-
ual characteristics, could highlight the most impactful scores. These analyses would complement the

MLP’s performance and provide insights into its decision-making process.

6 Conclusions

We present a framework for modeling diverse human preferences by learning to aggregate outputs
from multiple rubric-conditioned LLM judges. This approach tackles the challenge of aligning auto-
mated evaluation with human preferences—essential for reliable reward models in RLHF pipelines
and routing systems that match models to user queries. Using persona-driven synthetic annotations as
ground truth and ten specialized judges scoring dimensions from truthfulness to creativity, we train
two aggregator architectures: an interpretable Generalized Additive Model (GAM) and a Multi-Layer
Perceptron (MLP).

Our experiments yield three insights. First, learned aggregators modestly but consistently outperform
heuristic baselines, with performance strongly dependent on ground truth methodology—averaged
personas yield substantially better results than sampled individuals. Second, GAM analysis reveals
stable judge importance rankings, with Truthfulness and Instruction Following judges ranking highest
while judges like Harmlessness and explanatory depth contribute minimally: a concerning finding
for safety-critical applications. Third, our robustness analysis shows that learned aggregators handle
judge-level perturbations well but remain vulnerable to systematic training data contamination.

These results have direct implications for deploying multi-judge evaluation systems in RLHF and
model routing applications. The interpretability of GAM models enables monitoring of which
evaluation dimensions drive decisions, essential for ensuring safety-critical aspects aren’t overlooked.
The demonstrated robustness to judge perturbations addresses a known vulnerability of LLM-as-a-
judge systems to prompt variations. However, the sensitivity to training data quality underscores that
even sophisticated aggregation cannot overcome fundamentally corrupted preference data, making
careful preference data curation essential.

Our approach has several limitations that qualify these findings. We rely on synthetic persona labels
rather than genuine human annotations, potentially missing authentic preference complexity and
creating circularity with LLM-based evaluation. The fixed set of 14 personas may not capture real


===== PAGE BREAK =====

user diversity, and uniform sampling across personas represents a simplifying assumption. We study
only simple aggregators (GAM, MLP) optimized for R?, without modeling uncertainty or adaptive
weighting. Our experiments use 2,000 English text samples, limiting generalization to other domains,
languages, or longer contexts. Finally, personas and rubrics embed implicit value choices that we do
not systematically audit for fairness or stakeholder alignment.

Future work should validate these methods on human-labeled data, expand persona coverage to better
represent global user populations, and develop uncertainty-aware aggregation that can signal when
judge consensus is weak. The field needs standardized benchmarks that explicitly model preference
diversity rather than assuming universal agreement. As LLM judges become increasingly central to
AI development, e.g., shaping reward models, guiding model selection, and influencing deployment
decisions, building robust, interpretable, and aligned evaluation systems transitions from a technical
optimization problem to a foundational requirement for responsible AI development.

A.1 Our Aggregators

Our learned aggregators were trained on data to optimize the mapping from judge scores to human
preferences. The MLP uses a single hidden layer with ReLU activation: fg(x) = W2-ReLU(Wi2 +
b,) +2, where x € R?° are judge scores and hidden dimensions range from 32-128 based on dataset
size. Training uses Adam optimization with early stopping (patience=15 epochs) and MSE loss. The

GAM employs spline functions for each judge: f(x) = aa 8; (x;), where s; are smooth spline

functions with 5-10 basis functions per judge, regularized using X € [0.1, 100]. Both models undergo
a comprehensive automated hyperparameter search. Results for the hyperparameter search of the
GAM model can be found in figure[7]

A.4 Persona-Based Preference Simulation

A.4.1 Overview

We simulate human preference judgments by prompting a diverse set of predefined personas to rate
model answers. Each persona reflects a distinct perspective (e.g., technical rigor, safety concerns,
creativity, practicality). All personas use the same minimal preference rubric: they read the task and
candidate answer, briefly reflect, and output a single integer score from 0 to 10 (0 = terrible, 10 =
perfect) along with a short, two-sentence analysis. We then aggregate persona scores (mean across
personas) to produce an overall synthetic preference label.

A.4.2 Personas

Table[2]lists the personas and their intended emphases. In experiments, we may use a subset (e.g., 8
personas) sampled from this pool.

Table 2: Persona pool used for preference simulation.

Persona                             Brief description / emphasis

Professor                           Values intellectual rigor, proper argumentation, logical
consistency, and educational value in explanations.

CEO                                 Prefers conciseness, practical solutions, strategic thinking, and
clear action items that drive results.

Parent                            Prioritizes safety, age-appropriate content, clear explanations, and
practical everyday advice.

Student                            Seeks clear step-by-step explanations, examples, study tips, and
help understanding difficult concepts.

Data Scientist                 Emphasizes accuracy, statistical rigor, code quality, reproducibility,
and evidence-based reasoning.

Therapist                          Values empathy, emotional intelligence, non-judgmental language,
and supportive communication.

Child                              Ages 8-12; prefers simplicity, fun explanations, relatable
examples, and encouraging language.

Ethicist                          Focuses on ethical reasoning, consequences, fairness, and
philosophical grounding.

Privacy Advocate              Prioritizes data minimization, security awareness, anonymity, and
privacy protection.

Skeptic                           Demands evidence, spots logical fallacies, maintains healthy
doubt, and verifies claims.

Engineer                            Values precision, implementation details, efficiency, and
systematic debugging approaches.

Novelist                          Enjoys vivid description, emotional depth, narrative flow, and
imaginative approaches.

Non-native Speaker           Needs clear language, avoids idioms, requests cultural context, and
simplified vocabulary.

Lawyer                               Requires precise language, edge-case consideration, risk

assessment, and precedent awareness.

A.4.3 Unified Persona Rubric and Templates

All personas share the same scoring rubric and output format. Below we provide the exact system
and user message templates used to elicit persona judgments.

System prompt (persona rubric).
You are {PERSONA_NAME}. Read a task and its candidate answer, reflect briefly,

then decide how much you personally like the answer on a 0-10 scale
(O = terrible, 10 = perfect).

===== PAGE BREAK =====

- Use your own taste; no rubric is enforced.
- Think silently first; do not show your reasoning.
- Answer only with this JSON (no extra keys, no commentary):

"analysis": "<= 2 short sentences>",
"score": <int 0-10>

}

User message template.

==== ORIGINAL TASK ====
{USER_PROMPT}

==== CANDIDATE ANSWER ====
{MODEL_ANSWER}

==== YOUR JOB ====
You are {PERSONA_NAME}: {PERSONA_BIO}
Rate the answer as you see fit and output the JSON object above.

A.4.4 Scoring and Aggregation

Each persona returns a JSON object with fields:

¢ analysis: at most two short sentences summarizing the persona’s rationale.

* score: an integer in [0, 10], where 0 = terrible and 10 = perfect.

We compute the mean across personas as the aggregate score for each example. This aggregated score
is used as the synthetic ground-truth preference label for training or evaluation in our experiments.

A.5 Aggregator Performance with Respect to Diversity

In section [4.2] we show how the aggregator’s performance varies drastically with different ground
truth conditions, arguing that our simulated ground truth makes for a highly diverse ground truth,
which makes predicting human preferences more challenging. In this appendix, we quantify the
diversity of the different ground truths shown in figure[4] and further study how performance degrades
when adding more personas to the simulated human preference data we use as ground truth.

Figure 9: Ground Truth Diversity Analysis: Scatter plots revealing the relationship between mean
judge scores and ground truth preferences across different ground truth conditions. The linear fit
quality varies dramatically: UltraFeedback shows tight correlation (R = 0.89) due to single-model
consistency, while our Mixed Personas approach exhibits higher variance (R = 0.62) reflecting
diverse preference profiles. The correlation differences demonstrate that our diverse persona sampling
methodology creates measurable alignment challenges, yet the modest performance gains from
more consistent targets suggest the diversity provides valuable training signal that compensates for
increased variance.

NeurIPS Paper Checklist

1. Claims

Question: Do the main claims made in the abstract and introduction accurately reflect the
paper’s contributions and scope?

Answer: [Yes]

Justification: Lines 6 to 13 and the last paragraph of the Introduction addresses the concerns
of the guidelines, outlining our contributions and validation.

Guidelines:

¢ The answer NA means that the abstract and introduction do not include the claims
made in the paper.

¢ The abstract and/or introduction should clearly state the claims made, including the
contributions made in the paper and important assumptions and limitations. A No or
NA answer to this question will not be perceived well by the reviewers.

e The claims made should match theoretical and experimental results, and reflect how
much the results can be expected to generalize to other settings.

¢ It is fine to include aspirational goals as motivation as long as it is clear that these goals
are not attained by the paper.

2. Limitations
Question: Does the paper discuss the limitations of the work performed by the authors?
Answer: [Yes]
Justification: There is a section (5) that outlines and discusses the constraints of our research.
Guidelines:

e The answer NA means that the paper has no limitation while the answer No means that
the paper has limitations, but those are not discussed in the paper.

e The authors are encouraged to create a separate "Limitations" section in their paper.

e The paper should point out any strong assumptions and how robust the results are to
violations of these assumptions (e.g., independence assumptions, noiseless settings,
model well-specification, asymptotic approximations only holding locally). The authors
should reflect on how these assumptions might be violated in practice and what the
implications would be.

e The authors should reflect on the scope of the claims made, e.g., if the approach was
only tested on a few datasets or with a few runs. In general, empirical results often
depend on implicit assumptions, which should be articulated.

¢ The authors should reflect on the factors that influence the performance of the approach.
For example, a facial recognition algorithm may perform poorly when image resolution
is low or images are taken in low lighting. Or a speech-to-text system might not be
used reliably to provide closed captions for online lectures because it fails to handle
technical jargon.

¢ The authors should discuss the computational efficiency of the proposed algorithms
and how they scale with dataset size.

¢ If applicable, the authors should discuss possible limitations of their approach to
address problems of privacy and fairness.

¢ While the authors might fear that complete honesty about limitations might be used by
reviewers as grounds for rejection, a worse outcome might be that reviewers discover
limitations that aren’t acknowledged in the paper. The authors should use their best
judgment and recognize that individual actions in favor of transparency play an impor-
tant role in developing norms that preserve the integrity of the community. Reviewers
will be specifically instructed to not penalize honesty concerning limitations.

3. Theory assumptions and proofs

Question: For each theoretical result, does the paper provide the full set of assumptions and
a complete (and correct) proof?

Answer: |NA|

33


===== PAGE BREAK =====

Justification: There are no theoretical results, only a framework and experiments, the
equations presented only describe our model.

Guidelines:

e The answer NA means that the paper does not include theoretical results.

e All the theorems, formulas, and proofs in the paper should be numbered and cross-
referenced.

e All assumptions should be clearly stated or referenced in the statement of any theorems.

¢ The proofs can either appear in the main paper or the supplemental material, but if
they appear in the supplemental material, the authors are encouraged to provide a short
proof sketch to provide intuition.

¢ Inversely, any informal proof provided in the core of the paper should be complemented
by formal proofs provided in appendix or supplemental material.

¢ Theorems and Lemmas that the proof relies upon should be properly referenced.

4. Experimental result reproducibility

Question: Does the paper fully disclose all the information needed to reproduce the main ex-
perimental results of the paper to the extent that it affects the main claims and/or conclusions
of the paper (regardless of whether the code and data are provided or not)?

Answer: [Yes]

Justification: Before each experiment there is a short description of what was done, further-
more there is documentation on the GitHub repository regarding how to run the experiments.

Guidelines:

e The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments.

e If the paper includes experiments, a No answer to this question will not be perceived
well by the reviewers: Making the paper reproducible is important, regardless of
whether the code and data are provided or not.

If the contribution is a dataset and/or model, the authors should describe the steps taken
to make their results reproducible or verifiable.

Depending on the contribution, reproducibility can be accomplished in various ways.
For example, if the contribution is a novel architecture, describing the architecture fully
might suffice, or if the contribution is a specific model and empirical evaluation, it may
be necessary to either make it possible for others to replicate the model with the same
dataset, or provide access to the model. In general. releasing code and data is often
one good way to accomplish this, but reproducibility can also be provided via detailed
instructions for how to replicate the results, access to a hosted model (e.g., in the case
of a large language model), releasing of a model checkpoint, or other means that are
appropriate to the research performed.

While NeurIPS does not require releasing code, the conference does require all submis-
sions to provide some reasonable avenue for reproducibility, which may depend on the
nature of the contribution. For example

(a) If the contribution is primarily a new algorithm, the paper should make it clear how
to reproduce that algorithm.

(b) If the contribution is primarily a new model architecture, the paper should describe
the architecture clearly and fully.

(c) If the contribution is a new model (e.g., a large language model), then there should
either be a way to access this model for reproducing the results or a way to reproduce
the model (e.g., with an open-source dataset or instructions for how to construct
the dataset).

(d) We recognize that reproducibility may be tricky in some cases, in which case
authors are welcome to describe the particular way they provide for reproducibility.
In the case of closed-source models, it may be that access to the model is limited in
some way (e.g., to registered users), but it should be possible for other researchers
to have some path to reproducing or verifying the results.

5. Open access to data and code

34


===== PAGE BREAK =====

Question: Does the paper provide open access to the data and code, with sufficient instruc-
tions to faithfully reproduce the main experimental results, as described in supplemental
material?

Answer: [Yes]

Justification: There is a GitHub repository with all experiments along with instructions on
how to run them.

Guidelines:

e The answer NA means that paper does not include experiments requiring code.

* Please see the NeurIPS code and data submission guidelines (https: //nips.cc/
public/guides/CodeSubmissionPolicy) for more details.

e While we encourage the release of code and data, we understand that this might not be
possible, so “No” is an acceptable answer. Papers cannot be rejected simply for not
including code, unless this is central to the contribution (e.g., for a new open-source
benchmark).

¢ The instructions should contain the exact command and environment needed to run to
reproduce the results. See the NeurIPS code and data submission guidelines (https

//nips.cc/public/guides/CodeSubmissionPolicy) for more details.

¢ The authors should provide instructions on data access and preparation, including how
to access the raw data, preprocessed data, intermediate data, and generated data, etc.

¢ The authors should provide scripts to reproduce all experimental results for the new
proposed method and baselines. If only a subset of experiments are reproducible, they
should state which ones are omitted from the script and why.

e At submission time, to preserve anonymity, the authors should release anonymized
versions (if applicable).

¢ Providing as much information as possible in supplemental material (appended to the
paper) is recommended, but including URLs to data and code is permitted.
6. Experimental setting/details

Question: Does the paper specify all the training and test details (e.g., data splits, hyper-
parameters, how they were chosen, type of optimizer, etc.) necessary to understand the
results?

Answer: [Yes]

Justification: Outlined before each experiment with further details on training in the Ap-
pendix.

Guidelines:

e The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments.

e The experimental setting should be presented in the core of the paper to a level of detail
that is necessary to appreciate the results and make sense of them.

¢ The full details can be provided either with the code, in appendix, or as supplemental
material.
7. Experiment statistical significance

Question: Does the paper report error bars suitably and correctly defined or other appropriate
information about the statistical significance of the experiments?

Answer: | No}
Justification: Not relevant for the experiments.
Guidelines:

e The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments.

¢ The authors should answer "Yes" if the results are accompanied by error bars, confi-
dence intervals, or statistical significance tests, at least for the experiments that support
the main claims of the paper.

¢ The factors of variability that the error bars are capturing should be clearly stated (for
example, train/test split, initialization, random drawing of some parameter, or overall
run with given experimental conditions).

35


===== PAGE BREAK =====

8.

10.

¢ The method for calculating the error bars should be explained (closed form formula,
call to a library function, bootstrap, etc.)

¢ The assumptions made should be given (e.g., Normally distributed errors).

¢ It should be clear whether the error bar is the standard deviation or the standard error
of the mean.

¢ It is OK to report 1-sigma error bars, but one should state it. The authors should
preferably report a 2-sigma error bar than state that they have a 96% CL, if the hypothesis
of Normality of errors is not verified.

e For asymmetric distributions, the authors should be careful not to show in tables or
figures symmetric error bars that would yield results that are out of range (e.g. negative
error rates).

¢ If error bars are reported in tables or plots, The authors should explain in the text how
they were calculated and reference the corresponding figures or tables in the text.
Experiments compute resources

Question: For each experiment, does the paper provide sufficient information on the com-
puter resources (type of compute workers, memory, time of execution) needed to reproduce
the experiments?

Answer: | No}

Justification: Experiments are not too compute intensive and don’t require a very specific
setup.

Guidelines:

e The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments.

¢ The paper should indicate the type of compute workers CPU or GPU, internal cluster,
or cloud provider, including relevant memory and storage.

e The paper should provide the amount of compute required for each of the individual
experimental runs as well as estimate the total compute.

e The paper should disclose whether the full research project required more compute
than the experiments reported in the paper (e.g., preliminary or failed experiments that
didn’t make it into the paper).

Code of ethics

Question: Does the research conducted in the paper conform, in every respect, with the
NeurIPS Code of Ethics https: //neurips.cc/public/EthicsGuidelines’?

Answer: [Yes]
Justification: All guidelines followed.
Guidelines:

¢ The answer NA means that the authors have not reviewed the NeurIPS Code of Ethics.

¢ If the authors answer No, they should explain the special circumstances that require a
deviation from the Code of Ethics.

¢ The authors should make sure to preserve anonymity (e.g., if there is a special consid-
eration due to laws or regulations in their jurisdiction).

Broader impacts

Question: Does the paper discuss both potential positive societal impacts and negative
societal impacts of the work performed?

Answer: [Yes]

Justification: Second and third paragraph of Conclusions outlines the potential impacts of
our work.

Guidelines:

e The answer NA means that there is no societal impact of the work performed.

¢ If the authors answer NA or No, they should explain why their work has no societal
impact or why the paper does not address societal impact.

36


===== PAGE BREAK =====

11.

12.

e Examples of negative societal impacts include potential malicious or unintended uses
(e.g., disinformation, generating fake profiles, surveillance), fairness considerations
(e.g., deployment of technologies that could make decisions that unfairly impact specific
groups), privacy considerations, and security considerations.

e The conference expects that many papers will be foundational research and not tied
to particular applications, let alone deployments. However, if there is a direct path to
any negative applications, the authors should point it out. For example, it is legitimate
to point out that an improvement in the quality of generative models could be used to
generate deepfakes for disinformation. On the other hand, it is not needed to point out
that a generic algorithm for optimizing neural networks could enable people to train
models that generate Deepfakes faster.

e The authors should consider possible harms that could arise when the technology is
being used as intended and functioning correctly, harms that could arise when the
technology is being used as intended but gives incorrect results, and harms following
from (intentional or unintentional) misuse of the technology.

¢ If there are negative societal impacts, the authors could also discuss possible mitigation
strategies (e.g., gated release of models, providing defenses in addition to attacks,
mechanisms for monitoring misuse, mechanisms to monitor how a system learns from
feedback over time, improving the efficiency and accessibility of ML).

Safeguards

Question: Does the paper describe safeguards that have been put in place for responsible
release of data or models that have a high risk for misuse (e.g., pretrained language models,
image generators, or scraped datasets)?

Answer: |NA|
Justification: We didn’t scrape datasets and we didn’t identify any misuse risk.
Guidelines:

e The answer NA means that the paper poses no such risks.

¢ Released models that have a high risk for misuse or dual-use should be released with
necessary safeguards to allow for controlled use of the model, for example by requiring
that users adhere to usage guidelines or restrictions to access the model or implementing
safety filters.

e Datasets that have been scraped from the Internet could pose safety risks. The authors
should describe how they avoided releasing unsafe images.

¢ We recognize that providing effective safeguards is challenging, and many papers do
not require this, but we encourage authors to take this into account and make a best
faith effort.

Licenses for existing assets

Question: Are the creators or original owners of assets (e.g., code, data, models), used in
the paper, properly credited and are the license and terms of use explicitly mentioned and
properly respected?

Answer: [Yes]
Justification: Ultrafeedback is properly cited.
Guidelines:

e The answer NA means that the paper does not use existing assets.
¢ The authors should cite the original paper that produced the code package or dataset.

¢ The authors should state which version of the asset is used and, if possible, include a
URL.

e The name of the license (e.g., CC-BY 4.0) should be included for each asset.

¢ For scraped data from a particular source (e.g., website), the copyright and terms of
service of that source should be provided.

e If assets are released, the license, copyright information, and terms of use in the

package should be provided. For popular datasets,

has curated licenses for some datasets. Their licensing guide can help determine the
license of a dataset.

37


===== PAGE BREAK =====

13.

14.

15.

¢ For existing datasets that are re-packaged, both the original license and the license of
the derived asset (if it has changed) should be provided.

¢ If this information is not available online, the authors are encouraged to reach out to
the asset’s creators.
New assets

Question: Are new assets introduced in the paper well documented and is the documentation
provided alongside the assets?

Answer: |NA|
Justification: No new asset introduced, just a framework.
Guidelines:

¢ The answer NA means that the paper does not release new assets.
¢ Researchers should communicate the details of the dataset/code/model as part of their
submissions via structured templates. This includes details about training, license,
limitations, etc.
e The paper should discuss whether and how consent was obtained from people whose
asset is used.
e At submission time, remember to anonymize your assets (if applicable). You can either
create an anonymized URL or include an anonymized zip file.
Crowdsourcing and research with human subjects
Question: For crowdsourcing experiments and research with human subjects, does the paper
include the full text of instructions given to participants and screenshots, if applicable, as
well as details about compensation (if any)?
Answer: |NA|
Justification: No crowdsourcing was used.
Guidelines:
e The answer NA means that the paper does not involve crowdsourcing nor research with
human subjects.
¢ Including this information in the supplemental material is fine, but if the main contribu-
tion of the paper involves human subjects, then as much detail as possible should be
included in the main paper.
¢ According to the NeurIPS Code of Ethics, workers involved in data collection, curation,
or other labor should be paid at least the minimum wage in the country of the data
collector.
Institutional review board (IRB) approvals or equivalent for research with human
subjects
Question: Does the paper describe potential risks incurred by study participants, whether
such risks were disclosed to the subjects, and whether Institutional Review Board (IRB)
approvals (or an equivalent approval/review based on the requirements of your country or
institution) were obtained?

Answer: |NA|
Justification: No human subjects.
Guidelines:
e The answer NA means that the paper does not involve crowdsourcing nor research with
human subjects.
¢ Depending on the country in which research is conducted, IRB approval (or equivalent)

may be required for any human subjects research. If you obtained IRB approval, you
should clearly state this in the paper.

e We recognize that the procedures for this may vary significantly between institutions
and locations, and we expect authors to adhere to the NeurIPS Code of Ethics and the
guidelines for their institution.

¢ For initial submissions, do not include any information that would break anonymity (if
applicable), such as the institution conducting the review.

16. Declaration of LLM usage

Question: Does the paper describe the usage of LLMs if it is an important, original, or
non-standard component of the core methods in this research? Note that if the LLM is used
only for writing, editing, or formatting purposes and does not impact the core methodology,
scientific rigorousness, or originality of the research, declaration is not required.

Answer: [Yes]

Justification: LLMs were used for the judges and the simulated personas, properly outlined
in the corresponding sections of the paper.

Guidelines:

e The answer NA means that the core method development in this research does not
involve LLMs as any important, original, or non-standard components.

* Please refer to our LLM policy (https: //neurips.cc/Conferences/2025/LLM)

for what should or should not be described.
