Abstract

Semantic polarity in computational linguistics has tradition-
ally been framed as sentiment along a unidimensional scale.
We here challenge and advance this framing, as it oversim-
plifies the inherently multidimensional nature of language.
We introduce TOPol (Topic-Orientation Polarity), a semi-
unsupervised framework for reconstructing and interpreting
multidimensional narrative polarity fields given human-on-
the-loop (HoTL) defined contextual boundaries (CBs). TOPol
begins by embedding documents using a general-purpose
transformer-based large language model (tLLM), followed by
a neighbor-tuned UMAP projection and topic-based segmen-
tation via Leiden partitioning. Given a CB between regimes A
and B, the framework computes directional vectors between
corresponding topic-boundary centroids, producing a polar-
ity field that captures fine-grained semantic displacement for
each discourse regime change. TOPol polarity field reveals
CB quality as this vectorial representation enables quantifi-
cation of the magnitude, direction, and semantic meaning of
polarity shifts, acting as a polarity change detection tool di-
recting HoTL CB tuning. To interpret TOPol identified po-
larity shifts, we use the tLLM to compare the extreme points
of each polarity vector and generate contrastive labels with
estimated coverage. Robustness tests confirm that only the
definition of CBs, the primary HoTL-tunable parameter, sig-
nificantly modulates TOPol outputs, indicating methodolog-
ical stability. We evaluate TOPol on two corpora: US Cen-
tral Bank speeches upon a macroeconomic breakpoint as CB,
where semantic shifts are non-affective, and Amazon product
reviews upon rating strata as CB, where sentiment dominates
and therefore TOPol interpretation strongly aligns with NRC
valence. Results show that TOPol reliably captures both af-
fective and non-affective polarity transitions, those naturally
emerging from the data, offering a scalable, generalizable,
context-sensitive and interpretable approach to HoTL-guided
multidimensional discourse analysis.

Introduction

Sentiment Polarity scoring has long occupied a central po-
sition in Natural Language Processing (NLP), treated as a
synonym of Semantic Polarity since its inception, addressed
within the scope of Sentiment Analysis, conceptualized as a

scalar indicating the extent to which a text encodes a posi-
tive or negative perspective about an object (Mantyla, Grazi-
otin, and Kuutila 2018). Recent works dealing with Polarity
Classification, still framed in the lens of sentiment, however
seek to move beyond affective components for capturing di-
mensions such as sarcasm (Prasanna, Shaila, and Vadivel
2023). While this sentiment-centric framing of polarity has
proven powerful, it overlooks the multidimensional nature
of semantic orientation.

In response, recent academic efforts are challenging this
unidimensional view by developing multi-label and fine-
grained affective models (Demszky et al. 2020), and pro-
gressively extending polarity modeling beyond sentiment-
centric paradigms (Hofmann et al. 2021). These efforts
demonstrate that semantic analysis cannot be reduced to sin-
gle evaluative scales, as such reductions introduce bias by
overlooking the multidimensional context and perspectival
complexity in which meaning is embedded.

Topic Modeling (TM), the second most used NLP analy-
sis methodology, can capture topical dimensions in text cor-
pura, but it is designed to describe topical diversity rather
than semantic orientation, and usually does so in a static
manner. Recent advancements in TM explore context-aware
(Grootendorst 2022) and dynamic topic reconstruction over
time (Adhya and Sanyal 2025). However, these new ap-
proaches do not capture the full spectrum of semantic di-
rectionality, evidencing the need for methods capturing se-
mantic dynamism in a truly multidimensional manner, a rep-
resentation solution we conceptualize here as Semantic Po-
larity Vector Fields.

We introduce TOPol (Topic-Orientation Polarity), the
first framework for reconstructing and interpreting multidi-
mensional Semantic Polarity Fields. It retrieves the vectorial
transformations between topic-aligned discourse subsets by
combining tLLM embeddings with manifold learning, and
computes polarity vector fields based on cluster centroid
displacements. This enables capturing the vectorial struc-
ture, magnitude, directionality, and underlying polarity di-
mensions of semantic change.

TOPol advances the NLP representation toolkit by flex-
ibly modeling the change of meaning across human-on-
the-loop (HoTL) defined contextual boundaries (CBs). We
show that when applied to non-sentiment driven cor-
pora, TOPol reveals novel semantic dimensions such as

confidence-doubt or transparency-obfuscation, expanding
the analytical vocabulary for interpretive NLP. Conversely,
when applied to sentiment-driven corpora, it reconstructs
mainly, but not only, sentiment polarity dimensions, such
as disappointment-enjoyment, confirming that TOPol vastly
extends sentiment analysis into a broader class of multidi-
mensional semantic polarity analysis.

In summary, our contributions can be summarized as fol-
lows:

e We identify a critical gap in current semantic polarity
modeling: existing NLP tools inadequately represent the
multidimensional structure of polarity.

* We propose Topic-Orientation Polarity (TOPol), a novel
semantic representation framework for reconstructing
multidimensional semantic polarity fields and dimen-
sions of change, being flexible to HoTL context-
awareness.

e We introduce a contrastive explainability mechanism
based on LLMs, which interprets polarity dimensions
emerging from vector fields, and demonstrate its ef-
ficiency as compared to traditional lexicon based ap-
proaches.

¢ We validate TOPol on sentiment-driven and non-
sentiment-driven corpora, demonstrating its ability to re-
cover context-sensitive polarity dimensions across do-
mains and extending the traditional sentiment analysis
realm.

¢ We perform robustness checks for each TOPol core
component, showing that polarity field reconstruction is
structurally stable under perturbations, while the HoTL
CB definition is the key driver of variation in output.

Preliminary

We begin by formalizing the core elements of the TOPol
framework, which objective is to model semantic polarity as
a vector field induced by shifts in discourse across contex-
tual boundaries.

Definition 1 (Contextual Boundary). A contextual
boundary (CB), though it can be extended to more subsets,
is here demonstrated as a partition of the corpus into two
disjoint subsets D4 and Dz, corresponding to regimes A
and B, whether derived from the discourse or externally de-
fined. This boundary induces a directional comparison from
A-— B.

Definition 2 (Topic Clustering). Given the LLM embed-
ding space Z, we apply Uniform Manifold Approximation
and Projection (UMAP) followed by Leiden clustering to
obtain a set of & latent topics T = {T71,To,..., 7%}, where
each T; C Z represents a topic cluster.

Definition 3 (Centroid Pair). For each topic T;, we com-
pute its contextual centroids:

1        1
way 2 Ope de,”

zeDA                                  zEDP

where Df = T; Da and DP = T; Dz.
Definition 4 (Polarity Vector). The polarity vector for
topic T; is defined as:

vi= Me — wi
which encodes the semantic displacement of topic T; across
the contextual boundary.
Definition 5 (Semantic Polarity Field). The narrative po-
larity field is defined as the set of polarity vectors across all
topics:

.         B    A
V = {v1,V2,--.,ve},  with  Vi= by — Hi

Each vector v; is represented in a shared coordinate system
and rooted at a common origin, forming a vector field in a
normed vector space. This structure captures both the mag-
nitude and direction of semantic displacement for each topic
across the contextual boundary from regime A to regime B.

Methodology

In this section, we describe the proposed TOPol framework,
as illustrated in Figure 1. The pipeline reconstructs multi-
dimensional semantic polarity fields and interprets the un-
derlying polarity vectors that encode topic-specific semantic
shifts contained in the discourse. TOPol begins by generat-
ing dense vector representations for each document in the in-
put corpus using a general-purpose transformer model. Next,
it applies UMAP (McInnes, Healy, and Melville 2020) on
these embeddings, yielding a non-linearly reduced seman-
tic manifold in which document proximity reflects topical
similarity. TOPol then partitions the manifold using the Lei-
den (Traag, Waltman, and van Eck 2019) community de-
tection algorithm, grouping semantically related documents
in latent topics. Each topic cluster, or community, is further
subdivided into two (or more) context-specific subsets, de-
noted A and B, according to the HoTL-defined contextual
boundary. For each cluster, TOPol then computes a polarity
vector for each Leiden community by calculating the vector
displacement between the centroid of documents in regime
A and the centroid of documents in regime B. These vectors
are then anchored to a shared origin, forming a vector field in
a normed vector space, the so-called semantic polarity field
for the corpus. Finally, to interpret the polarity dimensions
contained in each polarity vector, potentially several per vec-
tor, we apply a tLLM-based contrastive explainability pro-
cedure. Specifically, for each polarity vector, we provide the
tLLM with the document subsets nearest to centroids A and
B and prompt it to generate contrastive summaries describ-
ing the dominant semantic distinctions between regimes A

and B, along with their estimated coverage and exemplar
text captions.

Defining Contextual Boundaries

The process of identifying and defining meaningful CBs is
central to TOPol results, as shown afterwards in Experi-
ments section. Therefore, TOPol does not conceive this as
an algorithmic tunable parameter but is rather an HoTL de-
cision. CBs define meaningful narrative regimes under com-
parison, bound to specific research questions, and determine
the granularity of the polarity vectors that TOPol detects
and explains. CBs may originate from external events or in-
ternal shifts in discourse, or a combination of both. In this
study, we show the operationalization of CB definition both
on external and internal regime detections, on Central Bank
speeches and Amazon customer reviews respectively. Also,
here we confine CB definition as a 2-set split of a given text
corpus, but this can be adapted to cover vectors with as many
intermediate steps as desired, or even defined by combining
complementary regime splits into multi-category regimes.

Reconstructing Semantic Polarity Fields

The modeling of directional semantic change across the dis-
course regimes defined by CBs is achieved by reconstructing
the semantic polarity field of the corpora under study.

Let D = {dj,do,...,d,} be a corpus of text docu-
ments. We obtain dense semantic embeddings z; € R™
for each document d; using a general-purpose tLLM pre-
trained on large corpora. The output is a set of embed-
dings Z = {z1,...,Zn}, where each 2; = tLLM(d;) cap-
tures contextual semantic information in a high dimensional
space. While the tLLM embedding space is semantically
rich, it can result in prohibitive computational costs and may
not be well-suited for downstream manifold-based cluster-
ing. To address this, we apply UMAP to preserve local topo-
logical structures, narrative latent topics, by mapping each
z,; to a low-dimensional representation u; € R¢, obtaining
the projection’ = {uy,..., Un} C R%, where semantically
similar documents are located near to each other, preserving
discourse topology.

Next, we construct a k-nearest neighbor graph over the
projected vectors U/ and apply the Leiden community de-
tection algorithm, optimizing modularity and ensuring clus-
ter connectivity. This results in a set of & topic clusters
T = {T1,72,.--, Tx}, where each 7; C U represents a
geometrically stable, semantically and topologically coher-
ent topic. Given a contextual boundary (CB) defined by a
human-on-the-loop (HoTL) operator, we partition each clus-
ter 7; into two subsets 7,“ and 7;”, corresponding to doc-
uments from discourse regimes A and B (see Preliminar-
ies section), though this can be expanded to more than two
regimes or to multi-category regimes (see Conclusions).

For each topic 7;, we compute centroids pa and yx for
subsets A and B, and the polarity vector for topic 7; is then:
vi = pe pa, These vectors represent the semantic dis-
placement of each topic from regime A to regime B. All po-
larity vectors v; are finally rooted at a common origin for
creating a vector field V = {v,,vo,...,Vv,} in a normed

vector space, the foundation for subsequent TOPol inter-
pretability. Each vector encodes both magnitude ||v;|| and
direction of semantic change, allowing the analysis of field
properties .

Revealing TOPol Dimensions

Once the semantic polarity field has been reconstructed, the
final step of the TOPol pipeline is to interpret the meaning
of each polarity vector v;, which captures the semantic dis-
placement of a topic across a contextual boundary. We pro-
pose a discovery approach based on contrastive explainabil-
ity mechanism and which leverages large language models
(LLMs) capabilities. For each vector v;, we select the top-n
nearest documents to the centroids 4 and ys? in the re-
duced semantic space. Let V4 and NV? denote these lo-
cal document neighborhoods: V4 = Top-n(u), NP =
Top-n(uP). NA and NP are passed to the LLM, which is
prompted to identify salient semantic distinctions between
the two sides of the polarity vector. The output of this ex-
plainability layer includes: a natural language label set for
the poles of each dominant semantic difference between V/A
and NP, a quantitative coverage estimate for each dimen-
sional pole on each subset, and a list of the most representa-
tive sentences and keywords for each polar dimension.

Experiments

We conducted extensive experiments for empirical testing
and robustness assessment of TOPol performance. This sec-
tion details the experimental setup and results for the ba-
sic formulation and perturbation variations of TOPol on two
distinct datasets.

Experimental Setup

Datasets. We evaluate TOPol on two corpora chosen
for their contrasting semantic properties: one is nearly
sentiment-absent, the other is sentiment-dense. The first is a
macroeconomic discourse dataset composed of 2,342 U.S.
central bank speeches extracted from the BIS repository.
These long-form documents, characterized by low affect
and technical language, were filtered from a larger multilin-
gual corpus. and segmented using a PCA-based macroeco-
nomic index. We define a contextual boundary using regime
segmentation derived from a PCA-constructed macroeco-
nomic index, selecting the May 2007 breakpoint preceding
the Global Financial Crisis. This yielded a final dataset of
600 speeches divided into pre- and post-crisis regimes. The
second corpus is a sentiment-saturated dataset: a balanced
subset of 10,000 Amazon product reviews, evenly sampled
from positive and negative ratings. These short, affect-rich
texts offer a natural benchmark for evaluating polarity inter-
pretation.

Due to structural differences between the corpora, we an-
alyze them separately, and chose different contextual bound-
ary logic: a time-based segmentation for the speeches and a
sentiment-based split for the reviews.

Transformer Models. While TOPol is model-agnostic
and compatible with any transformer-based embedding or


===== PAGE BREAK =====

generative model, we deliberately selected two complemen-
tary models that balance characteristics, performance and in-
terpretability. For document embedding, we used OpenAI’s
text-embedding-3-small, a general-purpose model offering
strong cross-domain generalization, high throughput, and
low computational cost—well suited for large-scale mani-
fold construction.

For the contrastive explainability layer, we opted for
Google’s gemini-2.5-flash, a state-of-the-art language model
distinguished exceptionally high input token limit of
1,048,576—far exceeding that of comparable models such
as OpenAI’s gpt-40-mini (128,000 tokens). This extensive
context window enables the model to ingest dense docu-
ment neighborhoods in a single pass, a critical requirement
for coherent polarity dimension labeling and high-coverage
contrastive interpretation.

Default Hyperparameters In addition to the perturba-
tion experiments discussed later on, we maintained a fixed
set of default hyperparameters across all datasets to ensure
methodological consistency. The selected hyperparameters
reflect informed defaults grounded in the theoretical behav-
ior of UMAP and Leiden algorithms, particularly with re-
spect to preserving local topology and optimizing commu-
nity granularity. Perturbation scenarios were constructed by
applying substantial deviations from these defaults to test
the resilience of polarity field reconstruction under extreme
yet plausible configurations.

Semi-supervised Reconstruction of Narrative
Polarity Vector Field and Shifts

We first evaluate the capacity of TOPol to reconstruct po-
larity vector fields in a semi-supervised setting, relying on
the CB definition and the intrinsic structure of the discourse.
This analysis assesses whether the polarity vectors naturally
reflect coherent and interpretable semantic shifts without re-
lying on predefined labels or external supervision.

Multidimensional Profiling. Having extracted the se-
mantic displacement across contextual boundaries in the
form of centroid drift vectors, we next assess the statisti-
cal and structural significance of the resulting polarity field.
The first step involves comparing the polarity field induced
by the HoTL-defined CB with those obtained under random
CBs. This procedure provides a baseline to evaluate whether
the observed semantic displacement is meaningful or could
arise by chance.

Random CBs are generated by randomly permuting the
CB assignment column, effectively decoupling the doc-
uments from their original regime labels while preserv-
ing topic composition. Figures 2a and 2b illustrate two-
dimensional projections of polarity vector fields computed
from the HoTL-defined CB (left) and a randomly generated
CB (right) for both the U.S. central bank speeches and Ama-
zon review datasets. In both datasets, the vector fields gen-
erated under the HoTL CB exhibit greater coherence and
alignment than those under random CBs (Table | and 2). In
the Amazon dataset, the vector field aligns strongly with the
primary semantic axis that separates positive and negative
sentiment across dense product-specific clusters (Figure 2b).

In contrast, the speech dataset reveals more heterogeneous
and dispersed polarity shifts, suggesting multiple semantic
dimensions underlie the observed transitions (Figure 2a).

To generalize this comparison, we perform N = 1000
simulations of random CBs and compute two key metrics:
(1) the average magnitude of polarity drifts, a proxy for the
overall strength of semantic displacement:

1  k
n= 2 >> IWvil
t=1

and (2) the average pairwise cosine similarity among
drifts which reflects the alignment of directional change
across topics:

5=     >  3
O44, al
where TepT is the cosine similarity measure between two

vectors x and y. A high overall drifts cosine similarity sug-
gests a low-dimensional, coherent polarity shift, whereas a
low value indicates the presence of diverse and potentially
orthogonal polarity dimensions.

The significance of the observed polarity shift is assessed
via a non-parametric test. Specifically, the p-value is com-
puted as:

_ 1+ an Lin; >Mnon
7           N+1

where MyoTL is the average drift magnitude under the
HoTL-defined CB, and ™m, are those obtained from random
CBs.

For the U.S. central bank speeches, the average cosine
similarity among polarity vectors is 5 = 0.12, likely indi-
cating a dispersed, multidimensional semantic change, as
we hypothesized before. In contrast, the Amazon reviews
exhibits a higher cosine similarity of s = 0.66, suggest-
ing a more uniform, sentiment-aligned polarity shift. In both
cases, the observed average magnitude significantly exceeds
that of the random CBs, yielding p-values of 0.000999,
strongly confirming that the detected semantic displace-
ments are non-random.

These results validate the relevance of the HoTL-defined
contextual boundaries, revealing semantically coherent po-
larity transitions. In particular, they indicate that while sen-
timent dominates the semantic change in Amazon product
reviews, central bank speeches exhibit richer, multidimen-
sional polarity shifts. This motivates the need to further in-
terpret the underlying polarity dimensions, which we ad-
dress in the following section.

Explaining Polarity Vectors’ Dimensionality To inter-
pret the latent dimensions captured by each TOPol polar-
ity vector, we employed gemini-—2.5-flash as a con-
trastive explainability model. Its extended context window
allowed us to include a substantial number of document
neighborhoods around each cluster centroid—tegardless of
individual text length—which proved particularly valuable
for the longer central bank speeches. The model was then

prompted to (i) assign a descriptive label to each polarity
dimension, (ii) extract and count supporting and contradict-
ing sentences, and (iii) identify distinguishing keywords for
each direction of the shift. Additional constraints and exam-
ples were provided to minimize hallucinations and ensure
that the model would return an empty response when no co-
herent signal was present. The ratio of supporting to contra-
dicting sentences served as a proxy for interpretability relia-
bility.

The approach uncovered polarity dimensions that reflect
deeper shifts in reasoning and rhetorical strategy. For ex-
ample, in the cluster 0 of the U.S. central bank speech
corpus, the transition from Amorphous Debate to Empir-
ically Grounded Practice captures a move from specula-
tive, politically entangled discourse toward data-driven in-
stitutional reasoning—suggesting increased epistemic con-
fidence and technocratic closure. In cluster 10, the three di-
mensions (Program-Level Reform to Macroeconomic Fis-
cal Strategy, Proactive Adjustment to Impending Crisis, and
Technical Details to Societal Values) span broader cognitive
and rhetorical shifts: from program-specific reforms to sys-
temic fiscal narratives, from incrementalism to anticipatory
crisis framing, and from technical descriptions to moral ap-
peals grounded in equity and collective responsibility. These
transitions illustrate how macroeconomic polarity fields re-
flect shifts in cognitive abstraction, temporal orientation, and
normative positioning.

In contrast, polarity dimensions in the Amazon review
dataset were more sentiment-saturated and literal. Exam-
ples include transitions such as Criticism to Praise, Infor-
mality to Formality, or Product Dysfunction to Product Ef-
fectiveness, each supported by dense clusters of emotionally
charged sentences.

Overall, the polarity fields reconstructed by TOPol re-
veal domain-specific structures of semantic change: in eco-
nomic discourse, they span epistemological orientation, an-
ticipatory reasoning, and normative framing—teflecting the
multidimensional nature of policy communication and con-
sistent with the low average pairwise cosine similarity ob-

served across polarity vectors. In contrast, polarity fields
in Amazon reviews exhibit tighter directional alignment,
matching the sentiment-defined contextual boundary and
producing polarity vectors that the LLM consistently ex-
plains in evaluative terms. These findings support TOPol’s
interpretability design and demonstrate the method’s robust-
ness across boundary types and data domains.

Benchmark with Sentiment-Centric Representations
To assess how the polarity fields reconstructed by TOPol
compare to a sentiment-aligned baseline, we benchmarked
our method against traditional sentiment-centric represen-
tations. This section thus serves to isolate the sentiment
component of the reconstructed polarity field, by examin-
ing whether sentiment is present, and to what extent it con-
tributes to the observed shifts.

We first implemented transformer-based sentiment anal-
ysis using two models: a general-purpose model (Distil-
BERT (Sanh et al. 2020)) and a domain-specific model (Fin-
BERT (Araci 2019)). For each document, sentiment was
scored on a continuous scale using the normalized class
probability difference:

:              Ppositive — Pnegative
sentiment =        P            S

>
Ppositive + Pneutral + Pnhegative

where p denotes class probabilities. This provides a general
sentiment signal that is widely used in applied settings.

In parallel, we implemented a lexicon-grounded bench-
mark using the NRC-VAD Lexicon (Mohammad 2025), ap-
plying the community integration method introduced earlier.
Each NRC-VAD term was embedded and projected into the
discourse manifold using UMAP model, followed by Lei-
den clustering to form NRC-VAD communities C;. For each
community, we computed the average Valence, Arousal, and
Dominance (VAD) scores:

We then assigned each polarity vector endpoint pa and pw?

to its closest VAD community centroid, using cosine simi-
larity:
A
Ca =argmin (He
Cy \ mele all

B
:    Li; Vi
Cp = arg min (4)
Ci \ me? esl)?

where v7; denotes the centroid of community C,;. The result-
ing displacement in VAD space is:

Avy? = vp — Va = (Av;, Aai, Ad;) ,

and

yielding a lexicon-anchored, three-dimensional polarity
shift per topic.

The results on the Amazon reviews align with expecta-
tions outlined in earlier sections. Since sentiment is the con-
textual boundary, both transformer-based sentiment scoring
and NRC-VAD projection reliably detected a sharp, inter-
pretable polarity vector field. Polarity vectors seem to be
uniformly aligned and sentiment-dominant, confirming the
narrow semantic structure of the Amazon polarity field and
validating TOPol’s approach of considering sentiment as
one dimension among many others.

In contrast, for the U.S. central bank speech dataset,
both FinBERT and DistilBERT failed to detect a con-
sistent sentiment shift across the HoTL-defined boundary
(sentimentginpert(D 2) —sentimentpinpert(D 4) * 0). NRC-
VAD projections also yielded weak signals. These results
confirm the absence of sentiment-focus change, consistent
with the low cosine similarity among polarity vectors and
the multidimensional, topic-specific interpretability found
in earlier analyses. However, while the global sentiment
gap across the boundary is clearly undetectable, the topic-
oriented analysis revealed localized affective shifts within
specific clusters, suggesting that emotional framing may
play a secondary, context-dependent role. The limited pres-
ence of sentiment, or its absence altogether, is itself infor-
mative, and indicates that the discourse boundary does not
(or only partly), reflect affective change.

Evaluation via Methodological Perturbations

To assess the stability and reliability of the semantic polar-
ity fields reconstructed by TOPol, we conducted a series of
methodological perturbation experiments. These controlled
variations target key components of the pipeline while hold-
ing all other parameters constant. By comparing the re-
sulting polarity vector fields and their statistical properties
against the default configuration, we evaluate the robustness
of the framework under representational and structural shifts
in the embedding and clustering space.

Perturbation of Polarity Field Space Our first robustness
check increases the UMAP projection dimensionality from
d = 50 to d = 75. This allows TOPol to capture more se-
mantic variance and latent structure, but at the cost of even-
tually introducing noise and reducing interpretability. The
trade-off between expressiveness and stability is dataset-
specific and best tuned through HoTL-guided experiments.

Table 1: Drift magnitude (7m) and pairwise cosine similarity
(8) under HoTL and random contextual boundaries for the
U.S. central banker speech corpus.

As shown in Tables | and 2, this perturbation results in
marginal variations in both drift magnitude and cosine sim-
ilarity. For U.S. central bank speeches, average drift mag-
nitude slightly increases, while cosine similarities remain
stable or even slightly improve, suggesting that higher di-
mensionality preserves coherence. Similarly, in Amazon re-
views, drift magnitudes remain consistently high, and pair-
wise cosine similarities are preserved. These findings sug-
gest that the semantic polarity field structure reconstructed
by TOPol is robust to moderate increases in projection di-
mensionality.

In the second robustness check, we increase the UMAP
neighborhood size from & = 100 (default) to k = 150, ex-
panding the local connectivity radius for manifold construc-
tion. This yields smoother topological structures and denser,
more aggregated topic clusters. However, larger neighbor-
hoods may also blur finer semantic boundaries, potentially
reducing sensitivity to local discourse variation.

We see in Tables 1 and 2 that under this condition,
drift magnitudes and cosine similarities remain highly sta-
ble. Notably, the Amazon reviews dataset exhibits consis-
tent average cosine similarities. These outcomes indicate
that TOPol’s polarity field representation is not overly sen-
sitive to changes in local neighborhood radius, retaining in-
terpretability across topological granularity scales.

Perturbation of Detected Communities The final robust-
ness check lowers the Leiden resolution parameter from r =
1.5 to r = 1.0, effectively increasing cluster size and conse-
quently reducing their number. This produces coarser topic
segmentations, which can enhance robustness by smoothing
over noisy boundaries, though it may also dilute finer se-
mantic distinctions and obscure localized polarity shifts.
According to Tables | and 2, this perturbation yields
a slight reduction in average drift magnitudes and more
pronounced degradation in cosine similarity. This suggests
that overly coarse topic granularity can obscure the mul-

meaningful polarity fields persist.

Conclusions

This paper introduced TOPol, a semi-unsupervised frame-
work for modeling and interpreting multidimensional polar-
ity fields across discourse regimes defined by HoTL con-
textual boundaries. Our empirical results demonstrate that
TOPol not only reconstructs coherent and interpretable po-
larity vector fields, but also reveals latent semantic dimen-
sions of change that go beyond sentiment.

Evaluation across two structurally different corpora
showed that TOPol adapts to both high-context, jargon-
heavy language and short, sentiment-rich text. The frame-
work remains robust under methodological variations. These
findings suggest that while the HoTL-defined CB remains
the principal driver of semantic displacement, the topology
of the polarity field is stable across moderate representa-
tional variations.

Our experiments further reveal that sentiment-aligned po-
larity dimensions constitute only a part of the semantic shifts
captured by TOPol, with the proportion of affective dimen-
sions varying significantly across datasets. This underscores
the broader potential of the framework for tracking non-
affective, epistemic, or rhetorical polarity transitions, such
as transparency—obfuscation or confidence—uncertainty.

Current limitations include the exclusion of topic clus-
ters that are unbalanced or entirely absent from one regime,
which may lead to underutilized polarity vectors or topic-
level dropout. Additionally, the non-deterministic nature of
LLMs makes this part of the framework difficult to repro-
duce, and their outputs may be prone to hallucinations de-
spite prompting safeguards. Future work will address these
constraints.

Finally, while the current implementation focuses on bi-
nary regime comparisons, the general structure of TOPol
naturally extends to more complex applications. Future
extensions will explore sequential or parallel contextual
boundaries, enabling multi-point temporal analysis or mul-
tidimensional polarity fields over 2D discourse partitions.
These directions open new possibilities for modeling evolv-
ing narratives and ideological shifts in various domains.
