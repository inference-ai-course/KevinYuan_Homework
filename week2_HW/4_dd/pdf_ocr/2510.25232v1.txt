ABSTRACT

Psychiatric comorbidity is clinically significant yet challenging due to the com-
plexity of multiple co-occurring disorders. To address this, we develop a novel
approach integrating synthetic patient electronic medical record (EMR) construc-
tion and multi-agent diagnostic dialogue generation. We create 502 synthetic
EMRs for common comorbid conditions using a pipeline that ensures clinical
relevance and diversity. Our multi-agent framework transfers the clinical inter-
view protocol into a hierarchical state machine and context tree, supporting over
130 diagnostic states while maintaining clinical standards. Through this rigorous
process, we construct PsyCoTalk, the first large-scale dialogue dataset support-
ing comorbidity, containing 3,000 multi-turn diagnostic dialogues validated by
psychiatrists. This dataset enhances diagnostic accuracy and treatment planning,
offering a valuable resource for psychiatric comorbidity research. Compared to
real-world clinical transcripts, PsyCoTalk exhibits high structural and linguistic
fidelity in terms of dialogue length, token distribution, and diagnostic reasoning
strategies. Licensed psychiatrists confirm the realism and diagnostic validity of
the dialogues. This dataset enables the development and evaluation of models
capable of multi-disorder psychiatric screening in a single conversational pass.

1 INTRODUCTION

Psychiatric disorders account for over 125 million disability-adjusted life years globally
 (2022). A major challenge lies in psychiatric comorbidity, i.e., the co-occurrence of
multiple conditions, which significantly complicates diagnosis and treatment. For instance, in a
Netherlands study of depression and anxiety, 67% of individuals with a primary depression diagno-
sis had current and 75% had lifetime comorbid anxiety calor Soe a DOAN  Yet, most
existing datasets and models narrowly focus on single disorders (Aich et al.|/2024} (2022),
while the few corpora covering multiple conditions lack fine-grained annotations and fail to capture
symptom co-occurrence and progression within diagnostic processes (Sun et al.| et al. [202 1} ' [Yin et al.| et al.
[2025} {Cohan et al.|/2018). As a result, large language models (LLMs) have not ee
evaluated on multi-disorder diagnostic tasks, limiting the development of reliable al] D0i4

that require step-by-step reasoning grounded in DSM-5 standards 2013).

To construct large-scale comorbidity diagnostic dialogues, diverse patient profiles reflecting real-
world complexity are needed. Such dialogues are essential because they simulate step-by-step di-

Figure 1: Framework overview: 1) EMR: construct patient profiles with 6 comorbidity types in
electronic medical record structure by extracting social media posts of users self-reporting multiple

ders assessment, to construct a comorbidity-focused diagnostic dialogue dataset PsyCoTalk.

agnostic reasoning and enable downstream applications such as multi-disorder screening, clinical
decision support, and the training of dialogue agents for psychiatry. Yet profiles alone often lack
structured detail to support accurate diagnosis. Electronic medical records (EMRs), by contrast,
provide a standardized format that includes a wide range of clinical data, such as symptoms and
medical history, which are crucial for later training. Still, EMRs can not handle diverse and complex
clinical scenarios during diagnosis and treatment planning and do not capture the dynamic doc-
tor—patient interaction, making it necessary to design a structured clinical dialogue flow that guides
the diagnostic process and ensures realism and clinical validity.

This work aims to advance comorbidity diagnosis through the construction of PsyCoTalk, a large-
scale dialogue dataset designed for both data-driven modeling and systematic evaluation of diag-
nostic reasoning. Our framework transforms self-reported social media posts into structured EMRs,
which serve directly as patient agent profiles to drive a three-agent diagnostic system (doctor, pa-
tient, tool) for generating clinically grounded multi-turn dialogues. As illustrated in [Figure 1] we
introduce an innovative data construction and dialogue generation pipeline and make three key con-
tributions:

e We develop a nuanced pipeline for EMR-driven dialogue generation that constructs synthetic,
clinically grounded EMRs for comorbidity patients, offering a set of 502 synthetic EMRs along
with detailed personal experiences reflecting common comorbid conditions, including Depression,
Anxiety, Bipolar and Attention-Deficits.

e We propose a clinically grounded multi-agent framework combining a Hierarchical Diagnostic
State Machine (HDSM) and Diagnosis Context Tree (DCT) for diagnosis, inspired by clinical inter-
view manuals and covering 130+ diagnostic states while following psychiatric assessment protocols.

* We introduce PsyCoTalk, a large-scale dataset of 3,000 multi-turn diagnostic dialogues grounded
in our EMRs and validated by psychiatrists, which is the largest of its kind and features longer and
more clinically deep dialogues compared to existing corpora.

bipolar disorder and schizophrenia, while MDD-5k is the largest Chinese diag-
nostic corpus so far, with 5000 multi-turn simulations covering more than 25 disorders. Although
MDD-5k uses a one-to-many case-to-dialogue strategy to boost diversity, it still treats each illness
in isolation and offers limited control over combinatorial symptom paths.

LLM-driven dialogue simulation LLMs now power many mental-health studies. Early work

agnostic empathy, and Patient-U 2024) combined a oh ioualtenpy rules
with LLMs to tutor counsellors. CPsyCoun (Zhang et al. turned structured therapy notes
into trainable conversations, improving topic coverage. Multi-agent designs add stronger clinical
grounding. The AMC framework links doctor, patient, and supervisor agents
through a three-level memory, enabling domain adaptation without fine-tuning. Building on AMC,
MDD.-5k introduced a neuro-symbolic controller and dynamic diagnosis tree to steer topic flow
let al.|[2025). These ideas inform our HDSM-Agents, which extends the agent paradigm with a hi-
erarchical state machine and context tree explicitly aligned to authoritative interview standards and,
for the first time, generates dialogues reflecting comorbid diagnostic reasoning. Yet no prior corpus
or simulator provides a large-scale, clinically structured resource for psychiatric comorbidity. Our
work addresses this critical gap for the first time.

3. PATIENT EMR AND EXPERIENCE GENERATION WORKFLOW

To create standardized EMRs for training purposes, we collaborated with psychiatrists to develop
a reference standard based on real clinical cases. Each EMR includes seven key components: De-
mographic Information, Chief Complaint, Medical Condition, Medical History, Personal History,
Family History, and Preliminary Diagnosis. Mental status examination and auxiliary tests are ex-
cluded due to the limitations of social media data. Detailed descriptions of the content structure and
language requirements for each section are provided in Appendix[A.3]

Figure 2: Overview of the EMR generation pipeline. Starting from social media posts, different
modules of the EMR are generated using distinct methods, with the overall process proceeding in a

top-down manner. The LLM used for EMR generation is GPT-40-mini (Achiam et al.||2023).

3.1 EMR GENERATION

Dataset Selection We selected the PsySym 2022) dataset as our base due to its
scale, depth of annotation, and suitability for modeling psychiatric comorbidity. PsySym originates
from Reddit users with self-reported psychiatric disorders, offering fine-grained symptom-level an-
notations across 7 major mental disorders. The dataset contains 5,624 diagnosed users, with an
average of 102.5 posts per user, making it ideal for our needs.

User Filtering To ensure meaningful interactions, we filtered users based on symptom diversity


===== PAGE BREAK =====

and frequency. We retained users with at least 10 symptom-related posts and 20 distinct symp-
tom types. Using a DSM-5-aligned disease-symptom graph, we excluded users with inconsistent
symptom-label pairs, ensuring clinical reliability.

Generation Strategy We adopted a modular approach to EMR generation, which outperformed a
single-step aggregation method in terms of information recall, classification accuracy, and reasoning
coherence. This approach involves categorizing post content into the seven standard EMR sections,
generating each section individually using either rule-based methods or LLM inference, and merg-
ing them into a complete record.

Processing Strategies _ As illustrated in|Figure 2| we designed four strategies for information ex-
traction and generation:

* Chief Complaint and Medical Condition: Using dual classifiers for symptoms and life events,
we generate binary symptom-event vectors for each post, which are then summarized and inte-
grated into prompts for LLM-based generation.

* Medical, Personal, and Family History: Posts are categorized using keyword-based classifica-
tion, summarized, and grouped into segments for LLM inference.

* Education, Occupation, and Implicit Age: Relevant content is retrieved through keyword
search, trimmed with local context, and formatted into structured prompts.

* Gender, Marital Status, and Explicit Age: Demographic information is extracted directly using
predefined keyword rules and rule-based classification.

3.2 PSYCOPROFILE DATASET DESCRIPTION AND STATISTICS

After two rounds of user filtering and using a modular strategy for content extraction and label injec-
tion, we generated 502 structured EMRs from retained texts. These cover six disease combinations
of four core psychiatric conditions: Major Depressive Disorder (MDD), Anxiety Disorder (AD),
Bipolar Disorder (BD), and Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD). [Table 1] shows user
counts before and after filtering, plus statistics on average posts, posts with symptoms, life events,
and distinct symptoms. Results show retained users provide rich, dense, analyzable content.

Table 1: User filtering and posting statistics by disease combination. U-/st, U-2nd: users after first and
second filtering; PS: symptom posts; PLE: life events; ST: symptoms.

To validate the realism of the synthetic EMRs, we compared them with real-world datq?| across
disease distribution, demographic factors (age and gender), and family history. The results are illus-
trated in|Figure 3] Disease prevalence in synthetic EMRs broadly aligns with real-world data while
exhibiting a more balanced distribution. Age shows a peak in the 20—24 group for synthetic data

versus 30-34 for (aac DONO CS ae oe likely reflecting the younger social me-
dia demographic (DataReportal||2020). Gender proportions are more balanced in synthetic records,
consistent with reduced stigma in online contexts (2021). Family history
is slightly overrepresented but remains within clinically plausible bounds. Psychiatrist feedback on

sampled records confirmed sufficient diversity and clinical plausibility, closely matching real-world
documentation.

>For real-world comparison, we obtained approximately 1,000 de-identified clinical records from the Na-
tional Mental Health Center, provided with institutional approval and used strictly for research purposes.

3.3. FICTITIOUS PATIENT EXPERIENCE GENERATION

EMRs provide structured and factual information, but they lack the narrative richness and variability
found in real patient-doctor interactions. By generating personalized fictitious experiences, we can
create a more comprehensive and varied dataset that includes not only the factual data from EMRs
but also the nuanced, context-specific details that arise in clinical conversations. Psychiatric diag-
noses primarily rely on language-based interactions, making it feasible to generate multiple coher-
ent diagnostic dialogues from a single EMR, provided the symptom presentation remains consistent

with the diagnosis 2025).

We therefore propose a personalized fictitious experience generation method grounded in struc-
tured EMRs to increase the diversity and realism of simulated dialogues. Unlike MDD-5k, which
randomly samples templates, our approach aligns sampled content with EMR attributes to avoid se-
mantic conflicts and incorporates clinically relevant lifestyle attributes. This ensures both semantic
coherence and diagnostic validity in generated dialogues.

Concretely, we employ LLMs to process each structured EMR via prompt-based instruction tuning.
For each case, the model is guided to generate a total of 5 personalized Personal Histories, includ-
ing both existing entries from the EMR and newly generated ones when necessary. In addition, 10
semantically consistent Fictitious Experiences are produced, all aligned with the EMR content and
free from logical conflicts. Here, Personal Histories refer to lifestyle or health background (e.g.,
“prefers light food, smokes and drinks occasionally, and exercises three times per week’’), while
Fictitious Experiences describe past events potentially affecting mental health (e.g., “was blamed
as the main cause of a failed company project one year ago”). As shown in the gener-
ation process outputs two structured dictionaries: D;j, for personal histories and DP, for fictitious
experiences. Given a structured EMR input xgmre and € represents the free-text narrative description
corresponding to a selected fictitious experience e. Formally, we define:

Die, Pris = LLM(Prompt(xemr))

(1)
é=LLM(Prompt(h,e)), h € Dhis, e € Dic

This two-stage generation mechanism enables each EMR to yield up to 50 unique fictitious expe-
riences, thereby enhancing the diversity, flexibility, and clinical realism of downstream diagnostic
dialogues while preserving semantic consistency. For detailed description of prompt please refer to

4 MULTI-AGENT DIAGNOSIS FRAMEWORK

To construct a clinically realistic and diverse dataset for psychiatric diagnostic dialogues, we devel-
oped a multi-agent framework, that integrates structured EMRs with dynamic dialogue generation.
This framework comprises two main components: a clinical-grounded interview pipeline, and a
multi-agent execution mechanism.

4.1 CLINICAL-GROUNDED INTERVIEW PIPELINE

The Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-5 (SCID-5-RV) is a standardized tool for assessing men-
tal disorders, offering a systematic approach to symptom evaluation and diagnosis. Adhering to


===== PAGE BREAK =====

SCID-5-RV grounds our framework in established clinical practices. To guide LLM-based psychi-
atric interviews, we restructure SCID-5-RV into two parts: a Hierarchical Diagnostic State Machine
(HDSM) and a Diagnostic Context Tree (DCT). This design ensures a structured, dynamic, and
clinically coherent dialogue flow.

Hierarchical Diagnostic State Machine (HDSM) The HDSM adheres to the SCID-5-RV proto-
col, assigning one sub-state machine to each target disorder (MDD, AD, BD, ADHD). Each sub-state
machine terminates in explicit diagnostic outcomes; for MDD, the terminal states depressionl-

depression5 in represent five mutually exclusive diagnoses (see the complete archi-
tecture in Appendix|A.7). In contrast to MDD-5k, which selected topics in random order, HDSM

enables the agent to both ask questions and refine the diagnosis iteratively, reflecting real clinical
reasoning. Following clinical design, the HDSM consists of a Graphical three-level hierarchy:

and their categories, see Appendix[A.5).

Natural language cues. Within each sub-state group, only the first question adopts a precise temporal
phrase such as “in the past two weeks’; subsequent questions use looser expressions like “recently”
to avoid unnatural repetition.

Binary symptom scale and flow control. The original four-point SCID-5-RV symptom scale (“un-
clear’, “absent”, “subthreshold”, “threshold’’) is reduced to a binary form: present or absent. Col-
ored arrows in|Figure 5lillustrate how different responses guide the interview trajectory. If a BLS
node has no valid successor, the agent performs a localized random traversal within the sub-state
group. The transition to the next diagnostic state occurs only after all terminal BLS nodes (ie.,
those without successors) have been visited. If the number of “positive” (i.e., “present’”) responses
exceeds a threshold, the group is deemed positive and follows the corresponding path; otherwise, it
is absent and triggers an alternative transition.

represent binary responses (present vs. absent), i.e., whether the patient exhibits the symptom.
Groups A00 and AOI are activated when > 5 “present” responses are observed; otherwise, they
follow the alternative transition.

Diagnostic Context Tree (DCT) To further enhance the semantic depth and contextual coherence
of diagnostic dialogues, we introduce the DCT, a tree-structured semantic controller that operates
alongside the HDSM. The DCT is designed to dynamically manage the flow of the dialogue, en-
suring that it remains clinically relevant and logically coherent. The top-level branches of the DCT
include three main categories: Family History, Personal History, and Experience Inquiry. These
categories are structured to capture the comprehensive background information necessary for a thor-
ough psychiatric evaluation.

The Experience Inquiry node within the DCT is dynamically triggered at the end of each turn, based
on the context of the conversation. This ensures that the dialogue remains responsive and adaptive
to the specific needs of the interaction. After the completion of the HDSM, the remaining leaf nodes
of the DCT are visited in a randomized order to maintain a natural flow of conversation. Personal
history templates are conditionally selected based on patient gender, ensuring that the dialogue is
tailored to the individual patient’s background (see[Figure 4] for male-specific examples).

By integrating the DCT with the HDSM, we effectively augment the elicitation of relevant back-
ground information, leading to dialogues that are more logically coherent and clinically aligned
with real-world psychiatric consultations. This combination ensures that the dialogue not only fol-
lows a structured diagnostic process but also incorporates the necessary contextual details to support
a comprehensive and accurate diagnosis.

4.2 MULTI-AGENT EXECUTION MECHANISM

Our simulator employs three specialized agents to facilitate each dialogue generation:

Patient Agent The patient agent formulates responses based on (i) the structured EMR, (ii) its
fictitious personal experience, and (iii) the current topic provided by the tool agent. Initial experi-
ments revealed a bias towards affirming all symptoms, even those not documented in the EMR. To
mitigate this, we developed a Disease—Symptom Description Knowledge Graph (DSD-KG) derived


===== PAGE BREAK =====

from SCID-5-RV guidelines. For each question, the agent consults the DSD-KG; if the symptom
is absent from the EMR or contradicts the provisional diagnosis, the agent responds with no. This
mechanism filters out hallucinated agreements, enhancing the credibility of the dialogue.

Doctor Agent The doctor agent poses questions according to the topic queued by the tool agent.
To avoid monotony, we defined five distinct doctor profiles varying in age, specialty, empathy style,
verbosity, diagnostic speed, and explanation frequency. Profile cues and high-quality few-shot ex-
amples are injected at prompt time, enabling the LLM to adapt its responses (e.g., concise, gentle,
or analytical). Reply length limits and a rotating pool of empathy phrases further reduce repetitive
responses.

Tool Agent The Tool Agent serves as the central controller, bridging natural-language dialogue
with the symbolic diagnostic framework. Its responsibilities are divided into two main categories:
tree management and dialogue coordination.

Tree Management

*Sub-State-Machine-OrderGen (conv) — list: Determines the execution order of the four
disorder-specific sub-state machines after the first dialogue turn. It supports two strategies: random
shuffle or symptom-informed mode, which prioritizes modules based on current symptoms.

* ResponseClassifier(conv) — bool: Classifies the patient’s latest answer as present or
absent and forwards this label to the HDSM to trigger state transitions.

* NeedExpBranch (conv) — node: Decides whether to enter the “Experience Inquiry” branch
of the context tree based on the previous turn’s content.

Dialogue Interface

* BuildPrompt (topic) — text: Generates aligned prompts for the doctor and patient agents
based on the current topic node in the diagnostic tree, ensuring semantic consistency.

¢ IsDialEnd (tree) — bool: Determines whether the consultation should terminate. The dia-
logue ends when all disorder-specific sub-state machines reach their terminal states and all required
nodes in the context tree—excluding the optional experience inquiry—have been traversed.

5 FINAL PRODUCT: PSYCOTALK DATASET

Generation Process We begin with 502 structured EMRs from PsyCoProfile. For each EMR,
we sample five distinct fictitious experiences from the generated Dg, and pair them with five dif-
ferent personal histories from Dyjs, resulting in five Fictitious Experience Descriptions (FEDs) that
capture patient-specific contextual narratives. Each FED is assigned a unique doctor profile that
varies in empathy level, verbosity, and diagnostic pacing. All three agents—the doctor, patient, and
tool agent—are instantiated using the Qwen2.5-72B model (Bai et al.||2023), deployed locally on
a server with four NVIDIA A100-SXM4-80GB GPUs using vLLM (Kwon et al. 2023).  For each
FED and doctor profile pair, we generate two dialogues using different sub-state machine scheduling
strategies: one that is symptom-informed and another that uses a randomly determined order. This
process yields approximately 5,000 dialogues. From these, we select 3,000 dialogues whose final
diagnostic labels match one of the six predefined comorbidity combinations in PsyCoProfile to form
the final PsyCoTalk dataset. As all human evaluators are native Chinese speakers, we release only
the Chinese version to ensure annotation quality. For comparative analysis, we include two addi-
tional Chinese diagnostic datasets, D* and MDD-5k, along with a de-identified clinical dialogue set
(Real-World Dial) obtained from a psychiatric hospital. Dataset statistics are reported in[Table 2]

Evaluation We conduct two types of human evaluation. First, 50 dialogues from PsyCoTalk are
rated in a double-blind fashion by five licensed psychiatrists with more than seven years of clinical
experience. Each dialogue is evaluated across six dimensions grouped under four criteria: Pro-
fessionalism, Communication, Fluency, and Realism. Professionalism assesses whether the doctor
successfully elicits all symptoms necessary for diagnosis. Communication evaluates (i) the doctor’s
proactivity in questioning and (ii) the patient’s responsiveness. Fluency measures (i) syntactic and
topical coherence and (ii) avoidance of redundancy. Realism assesses how closely the dialogue re-
sembles actual psychiatric consultations. Second, we perform an AB test using 10 two-turn excerpts
sampled from each dataset (PsyCoTalk, D*, MDD-5k, and Real-World Dial). The same five psychi-

atrists are asked to judge whether each excerpt appears real or AI-generated. Each excerpt identified
as “real” receives one point, and final realism scores are normalized to a 10-point scale.

Objective Comparison As shown in [Table 2| PsyCoTalk excels in scale and structural fidelity.
It is the only dataset for psychiatric comorbidity, with 3,000 dialogues-over twice D* and close to
MDD-5k. Each conversation averages 45.9 turns, nearly double other corpora. Utterance lengths are
34.0 characters (doctors) and 43.5 (patients), closest to real clinical conversations (28.3 and 35.8).
By contrast, MDD-5k deviates most, with overly long utterances that reduce realism.

To verify the effectiveness of the fictitious personal experience module under EMR reuse and to
validate the cross-lingual generalization of our pipeline, we assess dialogue diversity and conduct
a small-scale English generation experiment compared with existing corpora; detailed metrics and
results are reported in Appendix [A.2|

To assess diagnostic accuracy, we use initial EMR labels as ground truth and evaluate with exact-
match (all 5 disorders correct). A zero-shot Qwen2.5-72B baseline reaches 0.22 subset accuracy,
while our HDSM-guided multi-agent system improves to 0.31, a significant gain (McNemar’s test,
p=7x 10~-© < 0.001). On 200 sampled cases, GPT-40-mini and Deepseek-v3 achieve below 0.1,
Qwen3-32B below 0.02, and Qwen3-8B below 0.04. Per-label Fl: MDD (0.92), AD (0.81), ADHD
(0.64), BD (0.40). These align with clinical trends where BD and ADHD are harder to diagnose than
MDD and AD due to symptom overlap, subtler onset, and higher heterogeneity

Subjective Results summarizes expert evaluation results across six dimensions. Psy-
CoTalk ranks highest in communication (8.14 for doctor initiative, 8.24 for patient engagement),
alongside strong scores in professionalism (7.72) and fluency (7.42 and 6.79), reflecting coherent
and context-aware interactions. In the AB test for perceived realism, [Table 4]shows that PsyCoTalk
achieves a score of 5, second only to real-world data (6), indicating that its dialogue style closely ap-
proximates clinical expectations. By contrast, MDD-5k scores the lowest (1) due to its templated and
repetitive utterances, which reduce perceived authenticity. These findings confirm that our HDSM-
based multi-agent framework produces dialogues that are not only diagnostically informative but
also linguistically coherent and clinically credible across diverse expert judgments.

LIMITATIONS

PsyCoTalk focuses on four prevalent psychiatric disorders and their comorbidities, which reflects
common real-world cases but limits coverage of rarer conditions. While we conducted a small-scale
English generation experiment, the main dataset remains Chinese, restricting multilingual applica-
bility. Nevertheless, our pipeline is extensible and can be scaled to broader disorder coverage and
cross-lingual settings in future work.

6 CONCLUSION

In this paper, we introduce a two-stage pipeline that creates the first large-scale, clinically standard
dataset for psychiatric comorbidity. First, we develop PsyCoProfile, converting social media posts
into 502 structured electronic medical records that reflect real-world prevalence of six common
disorder combinations. Second, we propose a multi-agent interview and diagnosis framework that
transforms these records into PsyCoTalk, a corpus of 3,000 multi-turn dialogues mimicking clinical
interviews. PsyCoTalk provides the necessary scale and detail to train models for multi-disorder
screening.

ETHICS STATEMENT

The authors have read and adhere to the ICLR Code of Ethics. This work does not involve human
subjects, identifiable private data, or harmful applications. No external sponsorship or conflict of
interest influenced the design or conclusions of this work.

Data provenance and privacy. The raw posts that seed PsyCoProfile are drawn from the publicly
available PsySym corpus, whose collection was approved by an institutional review board (IRB
12022158P) and complies with the Personal Information Protection Law of the People’s Republic
of China. All posts are anonymous, stripped of usernames, time stamps and locations, and stored
under random identifiers. Our pipeline rewrites each post into a synthetic electronic medical record;
no verbatim text that could re-identify an author is retained. The fictitious personal histories and
life events are generated entirely by large language models. Five licensed psychiatrists reviewed
random samples and confirmed that no record contains protected health information or disallowed
content. The final dialogues in PsyCoTalk are synthetic and will be released only under a data-usage
agreement that forbids attempts at re-identification or clinical deployment.

Intended use and risk mitigation. The dataset is designed for research on multi-disorder screening
and dialogue modelling. It is not a diagnostic tool, nor does it provide treatment advice. Synthetic
conversations may still reflect biases inherited from web data and large language models; users must
apply rigorous evaluation before any downstream use. We urge practitioners to keep humans in
the loop when analysing sensitive mental-health text, and to follow relevant professional, legal and
ethical guidelines. Future work will extend coverage while continuing to consult ethics boards and
domain experts.

Societal impact. This work has the potential to positively contribute to early-stage screening re-
search and the development of more inclusive diagnostic tools for psychiatric profiles, particularly
in settings with limited clinical resources. However, the release of realistic synthetic dialogues and
records also raises risks of misuse, such as inappropriate clinical adoption or amplification of model
biases in downstream systems. To mitigate these risks, we emphasize that the dataset is strictly
intended for research use and should be paired with responsible modeling and evaluation practices.
Broader impacts will be monitored in future iterations in collaboration with ethics committees and
clinical stakeholders.

Annotator Compensation. We ensured fair compensation for all annotators. They were compen-
sated at a rate of $25/hour. This rate is above the local minimum wage and aligns with guidelines
for ethical crowdsourcing practices. Annotators were briefed about the nature of the task, estimated
time per task, and payment prior to participation.

A APPENDIX

A.1 USE OF LLMs

LLMs were primarily employed for data generation, forming the basis of our multi-agent architec-
ture. For the writing of this paper, we note that LLMs were used only to aid or polish the text,
for example in grammar checking and improving readability. They were not involved in generating
research ideas or analyzing results.

A.2 DIALOGUE DIVERSITY AND CROSS-LINGUAL ANALYSIS
A.2.1  INTRA-EMR DIVERSITY

To address concerns about EMR reuse, we enrich each dialogue with varied backgrounds while
retaining symptom consistency. We measure intra-EMR diversity by 1 — J(EMR;), where

2      |K; 9 Kp
J(EMR;) =     ,

with K’;, Aj, denoting keyword sets from dialogues generated under the same EMR 7. The average
diversity score is 0.647 + 0.030, i.e., only 35.3% overlap, demonstrating high variability among
dialogues derived from the same case.

A.2.2 COMPARISON WITH REAL CLINICAL DIALOGUES

We further compare synthetic (PsyCoTalk) and real-world clinical dialogues (1,731 patients, with
40.7% comorbid cases) using three diversity metrics:

1. Normalized Entropy H(X)/log,(V), where H(X) is Shannon entropy and V is vocab-
ulary size.

2. Hapax Proportion NMnapax/V, where Nhapax =

{wi € V | f(wi) = 1}.
3. Semantic Diversity 1 — MeanCosSim, with MeanCosSim = Ca) ic; CO8(Vi, V5),
where each session s; is represented by an embedding vector v;.

Table 5|shows that PsyCoTalk (Chinese) closely matches the diversity of real clinical dialogues,
while PsyCoTalk-eng exhibits comparable or even higher diversity than the AlexanderStreet dataset.

A.2.3. ENGLISH DATA AND CROSS-LINGUAL COMPARISON

Using the same pipeline, we construct a preliminary English dataset (PsyCoTalk-eng, 205 dialogues
from 41 patients) and compare it with the AlexanderStreet dataset (Alex, 1,254 dialogues without

diagnostic labels). As shown in PsyCoTalk-eng achieves higher normalized entropy and
semantic diversity than Alex, while Chinese PsyCoTalk exhibits a higher Hapax proportion but lower
semantic diversity than its English counterpart. This discrepancy may be attributed to language
structure: Chinese tends to use more unique or low-frequency words, while English dialogues often
display greater semantic variation.

A.2.4 WORD FREQUENCY AND PART-OF-SPEECH COMPARISON

We compare word frequency distributions in 200 sampled English and 200 Chinese dialogues, to-
kenized by NLTK (English) and jieba (Chinese). The top 100 high-frequency words (frequency
> 100) are categorized into four groups, and the results are summarized in[Table 6] Here, High-freq
Count (%) refers to the number and proportion of distinct word types from each category that ap-
pear among the top 100 (e.g., 28 Chinese words fall into “Symptoms/States,’ accounting for 35%).
Total Freq (%) denotes the cumulative frequency and proportion of all words in that category within
the sampled dialogues (e.g., Chinese symptom/state words occur 27,342 times in total, 21.88% of
all top-100 occurrences). This dual perspective captures both the lexical coverage (Count) and the
usage weight (Total Freq) of different categories across languages.

Table 6: Word frequency comparison across Chinese and English dialogues.

Although distributional differences exist, both languages are dominated by descriptive and
symptom-related words, with similar category rankings.  [Figure 6] illustrates representative word
clouds for the “symptom/state” category in both languages,  showing numerous synonymous or se-
mantically close pairs (e.g., anxious/SIUBR, mind/\y #/ii F £2). English words exhibit a more even
distribution, potentially due to linguistic structural differences.

A.3. EMR SECTION GUIDELINES

This appendix provides detailed specifications for each section in the standardized EMR template
developed in this study. The content structure was developed based on a standard clinical case tem-
plate obtained directly from practicing psychiatrists. This template reflects real-world documenta-
tion practices used in psychiatric settings and was adopted to ensure clinical realism and consistency.

Demographic Information should include the patient’s gender, age, educational background, mari-
tal status, and occupation. The language should be concise and factual.

Chief Complaint describes the primary psychological symptoms reported by the patient, along with
their duration. The text should be brief, focused, and clinically relevant.

Medical Condition covers the current psychiatric presentation in more detail. This includes the onset
and course of symptoms, any identifiable triggers, and the impact on the patient’s daily functioning.
General physical health indicators such as sleep patterns, appetite, and weight changes should also
be summarized when available.

Medical History lists prior medical conditions including chronic diseases, previous hospitalizations,
surgical procedures, known allergies, and history of infections. This section helps assess comorbid
risks.

Personal History records health-related lifestyle factors such as smoking, alcohol use, and drug
consumption. In female patients, it may also include relevant information on menstruation.

Family History identifies psychiatric or neurological disorders in close biological relatives (e.g., par-
ents, siblings). Information should be structured to reflect genetic predisposition or family dynamics
relevant to diagnosis.

Preliminary Diagnosis provides an initial clinical impression based on the information presented in
the EMR. This diagnosis is tentative and may refer to DSM-based categories such as MDD, BD, or
ADHD, depending on symptom patterns.

A.4 PROMPT DETAILS FOR VIRTUAL EXPERIENCE GENERATION

To enrich patient narratives with personalized and semantically coherent context, we design a struc-
tured prompt-based mechanism for generating Fictitious Experience Descriptions . The generation
is executed by the Tool Agent using an instruction-following large language model.

The input to this process is a template sentence derived from each patient’s structured EMR, format-
ted as: “IJ ama {age}-year-old {gender} with {diagnosis}, currently working or studying as a {occu-
pation}. Past experience: {experience}”. The fields {age}, {gender}, {diagnosis}, and {occupation}
are directly drawn from the EMR, while {experience} is sampled from the fictitious experience dic-
tionary D¥c.

The prompt guides the model to craft a first-person narrative that elaborates on the given background,
using the following system message:

“You are a powerful, imaginative text assistant skilled at writing stories. Given
keywords describing a patient’s mental health background and experiences, imag-
ine and write a detailed, first-person account of the patient’s past. Expand on the
causes, progression, and consequences of a psychologically impactful event. Do
not use metaphors, exaggerated language, or fictitious names. Avoid therapeutic
expressions like ‘under the doctor’s guidance’ or ‘trying to get better.’ The output
should be a coherent and realistic narrative.”

An example output is shown below :

Four years ago, I was a 12-year-old middle school student. I was cheerful by na-
ture, but often had trouble focusing. During class, I couldn’t help but look around,
and my hands were constantly doodling on paper. The teacher was very displeased

and reminded me multiple times to pay attention, but it barely worked. One day
in math class, the teacher was explaining a complicated geometry problem. I had
stayed up late the night before playing video games, and couldn’t follow the les-
son at all. My attention drifted, and the teacher’s voice gradually became a blur.
Suddenly, the teacher raised his voice, “You! Stand up!” I was startled, jumped
to my feet, heart pounding, and my face flushed with embarrassment. He stared
at me sternly and said in front of the entire class, “You’re not listening again, are
you? With that kind of attitude, how do you expect to succeed? Do you think your
parents would be proud of this?” The room fell silent. All eyes were on me. I
felt utterly humiliated, and tears welled up in my eyes. The teacher went on: “If
you don’t take this seriously, you’ll never amount to anything.” His words pierced
through me like needles. I felt defeated and deeply ashamed. After class, students
whispered among themselves—some mocked me, others looked at me with pity. I
locked myself in the bathroom and cried uncontrollably. For a while after that, I
began to fear going to school. Just entering the classroom would make my palms
sweat, and I couldn’t concentrate at all. My grades plummeted. My parents, anx-
ious and disappointed, constantly scolded me for not studying properly. A few
months later, I was diagnosed with depression and ADHD. The doctor said that
the public criticism had dealt a severe psychological blow, and combined with
academic pressure and high family expectations, it ultimately triggered the onset
of my condition.

This prompt design ensures that generated Fictitious Experience Descriptions are aligned with EMR
content, emotionally rich, and free from contradictions. It balances creative storytelling with medi-
cal plausibility, enabling the system to simulate realistic psychological histories without relying on
deterministic templates.

A.5 HIERARCHICAL DIAGNOSTIC STATE TAXONOMY AND TOPIC MAPPING

This appendix collates the full hierarchy of the HDSM, aligning each Basic-, Intermediate-, and
High-Level State with its corresponding clinical topic. States are grouped according to the four
SCID-5-derived categories:

(i) Affective & Cognitive Symptoms, (ii) Physiological & Behavioral Changes, (iii) Functional Im-
pairment & Risk, and (iv) Comorbid or Contributing Factors. For completeness, terminal nodes that
represent each sub-state machine’s final diagnostic outcomes are also listed. The lists that follow
serve as a reference for all experiments, ensuring that every state’s semantic scope—and its precise
role in the dialogue-generation pipeline—is clearly documented.

A.6 CASE STUDY OF PSYCOPROFILE

To aid interpretability, we provide an English translation of a structured EMR originally generated
in Chinese. As shown in the record describes a 20—24-year-old unmarried female student
with a history of major depressive disorder and generalized anxiety.

The chief complaint includes emotional instability, fatigue, and occasional negative thoughts. Her
medical condition outlines symptom progression over 28 months, including episodes of social with-
drawal, panic attacks, sleep disturbances, and compulsive behavior, with gradual improvement fol-
lowing psychological intervention. Her past medical history includes SSRI treatment, hospitaliza-
tion, and CBT, as well as group-based mindfulness therapy and weekly psychiatric supervision.

Her family history is positive for bipolar disorder (mother) and antisocial personality disorder (fa-
ther). Personal history reports menstrual irregularities, no smoking, regular caffeine intake, and a
preference for outdoor exercise. Demographics indicate a university education and no history of
marriage. The preliminary diagnosis is depression and anxiety.

Gender:                             Marital Condition:          Occupation:       Education: Currently           I

Chief Complaint: Anxious and irritable, with marked mood fluctuations and occasional negative
thoughts; fatigued and lacking energy. The total course of illness is 28 months, and over the past
month self-esteem and sense of well-being have shown some improvement.

A.7 HDSM FRAMEWORK

[Figure 5|presents the full structure of the Hierarchical Diagnostic State Machine (HDSM), covering
all four targeted psychiatric disorders. Each disorder is assigned an independent sub-state machine,
with corresponding high-level states (HLS) shown in the figure: A.1 and A.15 for MDD, F.25 and
F31 for AD, A.1, A.43, and D.1 for BD, and K.1 for ADHD.

Each HLS contains one or two sub-state groups (dashed rectangles), except D.1, which serves as
a summary node in the BD sub-state machine. Sub-state groups are designed based on SCID-
5-RV item clusters, preserving clinical logic and content alignment. Each sub-state group has a
predefined threshold, typically 3 or 5, for determining whether the collected responses support a
positive diagnostic transition. This design enables the system to emulate real-world psychiatric
evaluations with high clinical fidelity.

Terminal states, such as depressionl1 through depression5 in the MDD branch, represent
mutually exclusive diagnostic outcomes based on structured symptom elicitation. All state transi-
tions, node categories, and thresholds strictly follow the SCID-5-RV guidelines, ensuring consis-
tency between the simulated dialogue flow and professional diagnostic protocols.

agent interaction under the Diagnosis-Agents framework, where the patient agent is instantiated
with a personalized EMR and fictitious experience, and the doctor agent is guided by a structured
diagnostic state machine.

The dialogue includes a complete diagnostic process, from initial inquiry to the final diagnosis issued
by the doctor agent. We present below an English translation of the original dialogues for illustrative

purposes (see Figure 14).

Doctor: How have you been feeling lately? Is there anything in particular that’s been bothering

Eo)

you?

Patient: I’ve been sleeping okay, but when I wake up I feel completely drained, as if I haven’t
slept enough--- Studying feels tough; after reading for a bit my mind just stops working, and I
often drift off thinking about random things ---I don’t even know what I’m thinking about---
Doctor: Besides zoning out during study, are you able to focus on other daily activities?
Patient: I get distracted with other things too--- Yesterday while running, my mind kept racing
about homework and I couldn’ t keep going::-It feels like Ican’ t concentrate on anything for
very long::-

Doctor: How long has this difficulty focusing lasted? Have you noticed any significant mood
swings?

Patient: It’ s been about three months, and my mood’ s been pretty unstable. Sometimes I
suddenly feel very down, like I can’ t muster the energy to do anything—even my favorite games
don’ t appeal to me.

Doctor: Did anything significant happen three months ago that caused you a lot of stress? When
you feel low, how long does it usually last?

Patient: That was finals time plus a lot going on at home, so the stress was intense. When I felt
down, sometimes I couldn’ t shake it for a whole day—food tasted bland.

Doctor: Is your stress still high these days? Besides loss of appetite, any other physical
discomfort?

Patient: It’ s a bit better now, but I still feel dizzy and unsteady when walking. Last night I
couldn’ t sleep until 2 AM.

Doctor: Is insomnia at night frequent? When did the dizziness start?

Patient: The dizziness began around last weekend, and tossing and turning at night has been
common.

Doctor: Have you experienced a similar situation since that last finals period in the past six
months?

Patient: Not as severe as then, but I still get anxious under study stress. Coffee doesn’ t help—I
feel foggy and my efficiency is low.

Doctor: Have you felt tense and uneasy every day recently?

Patient: Yes, my palms sweat in class, I lack appetite, and I often wake up at night and can’ t get
back to sleep.

Doctor: After waking up, what thoughts run through your mind?

Patient: I think of past exam failures, feel I didn’ t study enough, and only calm down after

checking my books.

Patient: A little, but I keep thinking about exams and only drift off around dawn, feeling listless
in class the next day, yawning constantly.

Doctor: How long has this sleep disturbance been going on?

Patient: Looking at books helps a bit, but my mind keeps worrying about exams --- tossing and
turning unable to sleep--- often not drifting off until 3 or 4 AM and only just manage to fall asleep,
I feel listless in class the next day, yawning constantly.

Doctor: How is your appetite recently? Poor sleep must affect eating, right?

Patient: My appetite is okay, but poor sleep has shifted my meal times; sometimes I only have
two bites at lunch around 2 or 3 PM and I’m full.

Doctor: Half a year ago, did you have periods of several months feeling particularly tense and
worried?

Patient: Indeed, about six months ago I did feel especially tense and worried for some time, I
couldn’t sleep, woke up feeling panicky, constantly worried about failing exams or something
happening to my family, and at that time I couldn’t even be bothered to play my favorite basketball.
Doctor: Apart from exams and worrying about family, is there anything else that’s been
particularly concerning you?

Patient: I was also always thinking about graduating and finding a job, staying up late browsing
recruitment websites, afraid of not finding a good job and disappointing my family, and even food
tasted bland.

Doctor: Has that intense worry recurred intermittently from last year until now?

Patient: Yes, that feeling has come and gone since last year, especially when I see classmates
landing internships or jobs, I panic, fearing falling behind, often unable to sleep at night while
scrolling recruitment info, and I wake up groggy the next day.

Doctor: When that feeling of panic arises, can you control yourself and stop thinking about it?
Patient: Sometimes I try to distract myself by running or listening to music, but after a while
those thoughts return and I start worrying again.

Doctor: Do you feel utterly exhausted every day?

Patient: I feel especially tired every day, I zone out in class, and I stayed up late watching shows
last night and still haven’ t recovered.

Doctor: Are you experiencing any physical discomfort now?

Patient: It’s just that I feel a bit dizzy, my whole body lacks strength, my limbs feel weak, like I
haven’t slept enough, I can’t even muster the energy to walk.

Doctor: When you feel dizzy, do you feel particularly irritable inside?

Patient: When I’m dizzy, I feel restless, wanting to stand up and walk, but I’m too tired to move,
so I keep adjusting my posture in the chair to get comfortable.

Doctor: Lately, do you get angry over small things easily?

Patient: Recently I do get a bit irritable; last week, because my roommate threw garbage in the
wrong place, I couldn’ t help but loudly reprimand him. Normally I wouldn’ t react like that,
maybe it’s the stress.

Doctor: When working or studying, do you often zone out or feel like your mind goes blank?
Patient: I zone out when studying; the other day I was reading and suddenly spaced out for a few
minutes before snapping back. Ihadn’ t done that before; maybe it’ s because of poor sleep
recently.

Doctor: These days, how long does it take you to fall asleep once you lie in bed at night?
Patient: It takes about half an hour to fall asleep; sometimes I toss and turn thinking about things,
Idon’ t even touch my phone on the nightstand, just can’ t fall asleep, and wake up the next day
with sore eyes.

Doctor: How has your mood been these past few days? Have you felt particularly depressed or
unmotivated?

Patient: It’ s been okay, just sometimes I wake up feeling especially tired even after a long sleep.
After lunch I get sleepy and want to nap but worry I won’t sleep at night, so I force myself not to,
and after afternoon classes I feel drained, and I don’t even want to eat so I just lie in bed.

Doctor: When you lack appetite, do you have any other discomfort? Like stomach ache or
dizziness?

Patient: Lately when eating I feel some bloating, but not pain. I’ m not dizzy, just often feel a
hazy, spaced-out sensation, especially in class staring out the window and realizing the lecturer
has gone through several PPT slides.

Doctor: How long has this hazy zoning out continued? Can you focus through an entire class?
Patient: During the last class I zoned out halfway, stared at the trees outside for a long time
before snapping back and found that the teacher had moved on to the next chapter; my notebook
pages were blank with no notes.

Doctor: When did this zoning out start? Is it every day?

Patient: It started about two weeks ago; not every day but very frequently. Sometimes when
chatting with friends I suddenly blank out; my mind goes completely empty.

Doctor: How long has this blanking out during conversations with friends lasted? How long
before you snap back?

Patient: Since last week; when talking with friends I suddenly stare blankly, it’ s about a few
seconds before I snap back, and they think I’ m daydreaming.

Doctor: Has this blank mind sensation affected your eating or sleeping?

Patient: Eating and sleeping are okay, but sometimes while eating my mind goes blank and my
chopsticks just hang there until I come to and continue; friends say I’ m like a frozen robot.
Doctor: Are you still interested in your usual hobbies? Do you find them less enjoyable than
before?

Patient: I’ ve lost interest in running; I used to go to the field daily but now only once or twice a

week. It feels pointless; I don’ t even feel like listening to music.

Doctor: Has this feeling lasted more than a week? Besides running and music, are other activities
also unappealing?

Patient: Reading feels boring; the other day I bought a book and read two pages before setting it
aside. I don’ t feel like watching shows during meals; just shovel a few bites and that’ s it.
Doctor: Have you recently felt particularly down, or have others remarked you seem sad?
Patient: Lately I feel unmotivated to do anything; I don’ t want to play my favorite games, I
canceled friends’ invitations to play ball, and just want to sit alone and stare.

Doctor: Has this mood been going on for more than two weeks? Any impact on sleeping at night?
Patient: It’ s okay; I can sleep, but I wake up still feeling tired, too drained for class or hanging
out with friends.

Doctor: During this time, have you felt everything is meaningless?

Patient: I do feel unmotivated; I don’ t want to play my favorite games, and I just mechanically
eat meals; it feels meaningless.

Doctor: How long has this condition lasted?

Patient: About three weeks. I mechanically get up, attend class, then go back to the dorm and
scroll on my phone. I’ m too lazy to go to the cafeteria, and I don’ t want to play basketball with
my roommate.

Doctor: How’ s your appetite lately? Any change in weight?

Patient: My appetite is okay, weight hasn’ t changed much. I lack appetite—I often order
takeout and eat only a couple bites.

Doctor: Can you get enough sleep at night?

Patient: I sleep reasonably well—about seven to eight hours—but sometimes I wake once and
toss and turn before I fall back asleep, and I’ ma bit sleepy in class.

Doctor: Have you recently thought life is meaningless?

Patient: I do feel unmotivated; I even don’ t want to play my favorite basketball. I lie down,
scroll on my phone to kill time, and I make excuses to decline friends’ invitations.

Doctor: During this period, is it easy for you to get distracted when doing things?

Patient: It’ s always hard to concentrate; I read two pages before zoning out, and in lectures I
start thinking about other things—my efficiency is really low.

Doctor: Have you been feeling tired lately? Do you still have enough energy?

Patient: I do feel tired; it’ s hard to get up in the morning, and I get winded running more easily,
but I still manage to work out about half an hour each day.

Doctor: Do you feel there is anything you’ re proud of?

Patient: Not much to be proud of—just sticking to a half-hour run daily; even when I don’ t feel
like moving, I go, so that’ s maybe a small progress.

Doctor: Recently, have you felt especially irritable or unable to sit still?

Patient: I do feel restless; I often have to stand and walk around, especially in class, feeling

uncomfortable and needing to change posture now and then.

Doctor: Lately, have you suddenly felt very excited or in a particularly good mood?

Patient: No, I haven’ t felt excited or in particularly good spirits; most of the time it’ s flat.
Occasionally going out to eat with friends makes me happy, but it passes quickly.

Doctor: In the past month, have there been days where you frequently feel like snapping?
Patient: I haven’ t really snapped this past month; sometimes I zone out in class and feel tired
and want a break.

Doctor: Have you ever felt that you were invincible?

Patient: I did feel that way before, especially in high school when the academic pressure was
intense—I believed that as long as I worked hard I could do well, stayed up late studying without
feeling tired, and loved showing off my grades and abilities to classmates. Now it seems a bit
laughable and unrealistic. Honestly, I haven’ t felt that way in a long time. Since university I’ ve
become more aware of my limitations and shortcomings. Mainly because I found I can’ t do
everything well—for example, I often don’ t understand what the physics teacher is saying in
class and do poorly on exams. Also, after joining some clubs, I realized my organizational and
coordination skills are really poor. Lately I often feel pretty incompetent and useless ---

Doctor: How do you cope when you don’ t understand the physics class?

Patient: I grit my teeth and listen; if that doesn’ t work I check the textbook or ask classmates. I
don’ t want the teacher to see don’ t understand. Sometimes I go to the library for reference
materials, but it’ s not very effective and I still often can’ t understand those formulas.

Doctor: How long have you been feeling incompetent and useless?

Patient: That feeling started about last year when academic pressure was intense. Seeing others
keeping up with coursework made me feel useless, unable to understand basic physics formulas,
feeling frustrated every day.

Doctor: Do you still participate in club activities now or have you given up?

Patient: I rarely attend club activities now; after that physics exam failure last year I quit the
robotics club because I felt embarrassed and didn’ t want to face others. Occasionally I play
games in my dorm to pass time, but I always feel unmotivated.

Doctor: Can playing games recently temporarily make you forget those frustrations?

Patient: When playing games I still think about those things. I space out and if I lose I get more
irritated, then shut off and stare blankly all day.

Doctor: Last time you said you spaced out all day; how did you feel? Did you have any overly
negative or extreme thoughts?

Patient: When spacing out my mind is blank and I don’ t think of anything in particular; I just sit
and gaze out the window or at my phone screen. Time passes quickly; when I come to it’ s dark
and sometimes I forget to eat lunch.

Doctor: When spacing out, do you feel especially tired or suddenly energized?

Patient: When spacing out I don’ t feel tired or energized—just calmly sitting with slightly dry
eyes that I blink or rub. Occasionally I hear a dog barking downstairs and realize how much time

has passed.

Doctor: Are you usually active? Do you exercise regularly?

Patient: I usually jog on the field for half an hour and go to the gym for strength training on
weekends. I feel my fitness is okay, though sometimes I feel tired after running and want to sleep
early.

Doctor: Feeling tired after running and wanting to sleep early? Do you drink a lot of coffee
during the day to stay alert?

Patient: I don’ t drink much coffee during the day; occasionally I buy a latte before morning
class to refresh, but Idon’ t dare drink too much for fear of insomnia affecting next-day studies;
basically one cup per day.

Doctor: Has anyone in your family had emotional problems?

Patient: My father has Alzheimer’ s and my uncle suffers from severe depression. That does
worry me sometimes, fearing I might inherit those issues.

Doctor: Have you tried using alcohol or other means to alleviate this worry recently?

Patient: I haven’ t tried alcohol or other means to ease the worry. I just run daily and do strength
training; I feel my physical condition is okay and can keep negative thoughts in check.

Doctor: Besides exercise, do you have other relaxation methods? How is your sleep?

Patient: Lately I listen to soft music or podcasts before bed, sometimes have a cup of warm milk.
My sleep is okay; I can generally get around seven hours.

Doctor: Diagnosis complete: Past major depressive episode and past generalized anxiety disorder.
